        <p>Text: <br> Revelation 1:1-2 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto
        his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his
        angel unto his servant John: 2  Who bare record of the word of God, and of the
        testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</p>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>God is omniscient; nothing happens without his knowledge and He allows certain things to
        happen not because He doesn’t have power to stop them from happening but because He has
        other reasons for letting them happen. His interest was however, that the world should know
        what were about to happen or were already happening and that the faithful ones should be
        prepared to make sacrifices where necessary. In this lesson, we are going to mention some
        prophecies that specifically point to the apostasy of the early church either in plain texts or in
        symbols.</p>
        <h2>THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS LESSON</h2>
        <p>The main objectives of this lesson are simply:</p>
        <p>- To help us understand the scriptures more perfectly with regards to prophecies and
        their fulfillments. (The manifold wisdom of God is made known by the church -
        Ephesians 3:10)</p>
        <p>- To help us discern what came from God in Christianity and what came from Satan also
        in Christianity. (Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power
        and signs and lying wonders - 2 Thessalonians 2:9)</p>
        <p>- It will help us get mentally prepared for the time the prophecies signify. (For there
        shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders;
        insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. 25  Behold, I have
        told you before. - Matthew 24:24-25)</p>
        <p>- To help us understand that the term Christendom does not necessarily mean
        Christianity. (Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of
        God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. – 1 John 4:1)</p>
        <h2>To help us understand that the term Christendom does not necessarily mean
        Christianity. (Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of
        God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. – 1 John 4:1)</h2>
        <big>To help us understand that the term Christendom does not necessarily mean
        Christianity. (Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of
        God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. – 1 John 4:1)</big><br>

        <p>To help us understand that the term Christendom does not necessarily mean
Christianity. (Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of
God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. – 1 John 4:1)</p>
<big>People’s faith will diminish because of widespread lawlessness.</big><br>
<p>Matthew 24:10-13  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and
    shall hate one another. 11  And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
    12  And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 13  But he that
    shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p>
    <h2>FROM PETER THE APOSTLE</h2>
    <big>False teachers will arise in Christianity with various heresies and have large followership.</big><br>
    <p>2 Peter 2:1-2  But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall
        be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying
        the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. 2  And many
        shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil
        spoken of.</p>
        <h2>FROM JOHN THE APOSTLE</h2>
        <big>Not all the spirits operating in Christianity are from God.</big>
        <br>
        <p>1 John 4:1  Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God:
        because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</p>
        <big>Anti Christs were once Christians before their departures.</big><br>
        <p>1 John 2:18-19  Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist
        shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last
        time. 19  They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they
        would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made
        manifest that they were not all of us.</p>
        <big>The spirit of devils will perform miracles to support the activities of the false prophets.</big><br>
        <p>Revelation 16:13-14  And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of
        the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false
        prophet. 14  For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the
        kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day
        of God Almighty.</p>
        <big>A figure like the a lamb (Jesus) will emerge but speaking like a Dragon (Satan).</big><br>
        <p>Revelation 13:11-13  And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had
        two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 12  And he exerciseth all the power of
        the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to
        worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</p>
        <h2>PAUL THE APOSTLE</h2>
        <big>The Holy Spirit speaks clearly that some will leave the true Christianity and embrace
        demonized versions of Christianity.</big><br>
        <p>1 Timothy 4:1-3  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall
        depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 2  Speaking
        lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 3  Forbidding to marry,
        and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with
        thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</p>
        <big>An overall religious officer will emerge and lead people to perdition (damnation) before the
         second coming of Christ.</big><br>
        <p>2 Thessalonians 2:3-4  Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not
        come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of
        perdition; 4  Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is
        worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is
        God.</p>
        <big>Many men will join the Christian religion to pervert the gospel and make followers for
        themselves.</big><br>
        <p>Acts 20:29-30  For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in
        among you, not sparing the flock. 30  Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking
        perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</p>
        <big>Many people will be removed from the true bible teachings to adulterated bible teachings.</big><br>
        <p>Galatians 1:6-8  I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the
        grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7  Which is not another; but there be some that
        trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 8  But though we, or an angel from
        heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,
        let him be accursed.</p>
        <big>People will lose interest in the sound bible teachings and embrace the kind of teachings that
        make them feel happy.</big><br>
        <p>2 Timothy 4:3-4  For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but
        after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; 4  And
        they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>
        <big>Some crafty orators are already waiting to deceive the naïve minds with all sorts of crafted
            fables.</big><br>
            <p>Ephesians 4:14  That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried
            about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness,
            whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</p>
            <h2>JUDE</h2>
            <big>Men secretly joined Christianity to turn the grace of God into material lusts.</big><br>
            <p>Jude 1:3-5  Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation,
            it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend
            for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. 4  For there are certain men crept
            in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men,
            turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our
            Lord Jesus Christ. 5  I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this,
            how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward
            destroyed them that believed not.</p>
            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>We cannot see all these prophecies and warnings concerning departures from true Christianity
            and still blind our minds and continue in whatever religious errors we are practicing. Of what
            use is it for us to live all our lives practicing Christianity in error? It is evident that all Christians
            that believe or practice doctrines that are contrary to the bible will forever be denounced by
            God.</p>
            <p>Matthew 15:8-9  This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me
            with their lips; but their heart is far from me. 9  But in vain they do worship me, teaching
            for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
            <p>Matthew 7:21-23  Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
            kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 22  Many
            will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy
            name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 23  And then
            will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</p>
            <p>2 John 1:8-10  Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought,
            but that we receive a full reward. 9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the
            doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both
            the Father and the Son. 10  If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
            receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</p>
            <p>2 John 1:8 above advises us to be careful about what we do in the name of Christianity so, we
            won’t lose what we have worked for, which is eternal life. Your salvation is in your own hands.
            You are advised to take that bold step reject churches that practice compromised doctrines of
            Christ.</p>
