        <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
        <p>
          Every disciple of Christ, Christian, believer in Christ, born again,
          etc. must belong to the true church. The Christian Church started in
          Jerusalem about 33AD as one universal church and they all practiced
          one form of doctrine globally and were identified with the same names
          globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, during the period of their oneness, the Holy Spirit
          spoke in prophecy that false teachers and prophets would arise from
          within and outside that church and form more Christian groups which
          they would deceive and exploit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Holy Spirit also spoke about the sudden spiritual decay of the
          symbolic Babylon and admonished the faithful believers to depart from
          her to avoid sharing in her eternal punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This provides the world with tremendous challenge of identifying the
          false churches talked about, together with the false prophets, the
          symbolic Babylon and strive not to be in their camps to avoid eternal
          destruction. The only way we can identify the false churches and
          prophets is by knowing the facts about the true Church with regards to
          its history, establishment, identity, pattern of worship, pattern of
          organisation and other vital facts. This knowledge will help us to
          identify and belong to that one universal church that existed from
          around 33AD before things went wrong religiously in the course of
          history.This provides the world with tremendous challenge of

          course of history.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should not advocate for the wrong churches to be left alone to
          exist because Ephesians 5:11 says:
        </p>
        <p>
          And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
          rather reprove them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is futile to hope that God would overlook their wrongs because he
          never did so in the past . He did not overlook the wrongs of the
          generation of Noah before the flood. He did not overlook the wrongs of
          Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring cities. He did not overlook
          the wrongs of Israel his loved nation. He will not also overlook the
          wrongs of false prophets and false churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          This theme is therefore designed to take us down the memory lane of
          the historical facts about the one true bible church from its founding
          in 33AD to the present day with regards to its establishment, apostasy
          and restoration. May God bless us as we study.
        </p>
        <h2>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST</h2>
        <p>
          This has to do with ancient plans of God for the establishment of
          Church of Christ which include:
        </p>
        <p>- The prophecies concerning its establishment in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>
          Daniel 2:44 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set
          up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall
          not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume
          all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Micah 4:1-2 1 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the
          mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of
          the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people
          shall flow unto it.  2 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and
          let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God
          of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
          paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of
          the LORD from Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          - The prayer concerning the coming of the kingdom of Christ or of God
          and the revelation of God’s will in form of the New Testament Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathew 6:10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          - The promise of Christ to build his church and imminent take-off of
          his kingdom or church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathew 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon
          this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
          prevail against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark 9:1 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be
          some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till
          they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
        </p>
        <p>
          - The actual establishment of the church or kingdom in Jerusalem about
          33AD. Acts 2:1-42, Colossians 1:13
        </p>
        <p>
          - The worship and organization of the church established in Jerusalem
          by Christ.
        </p>
        <p>- Worship Acts 2:42 &amp; 47</p>
        <p>- Organization Acts 14:23, Titus 1:5, Philippians 1:1</p>
        <h2>THE APOSTASY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
        <br />
        <big>This includes:</big>
        <p>- Prophecies concerning departures from the established church.</p>
        <p>
          1 Timothy 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
          times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
          spirits, and doctrines of devils
        </p>
        <p>
          Acts 20:29-30 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall
          grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.  30 Also of
          your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw
          away disciples after them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Timothy 4:3-4 3 For the time will come when they will not endure
          sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to
          themselves teachers, having itching ears;  4 and they shall turn
          away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Galatians 1:6-7 6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that
          called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:  7 which is
          not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the
          gospel of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Peter 2:1-3 1 But there were false prophets also among the people,
          even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall
          bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them,
          and bring upon themselves swift destruction.  2 And many shall follow
          their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be
          evil spoken of.  3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned
          words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time
          lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.
        </p>
        <p>- History of actual apostasy and areas of apostasy such as:</p>
        <p>
          - Name: Ignatius of Antioch first used the word Catholic and after
          Roman Empire took over the church and mixed it with their government,
          they invented a lot of doctrines and practices and named them CATHOLIC
          hence the name Roman Catholic Church was officially born and prophecy
          of apostasy officially fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Organization: Every church had ordained local elders but the now
          Roman Catholic Church cum Empire exalted Roman bishop above all
          bishops and had all the Roman churches subjected under his rule thus
          fulfilling the prophecy of the Man of Sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that
          day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that
          man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;  4 who opposeth and
          exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped;
          so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that
          he is God
        </p>

        <h2>THE RESTORATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
        <br />
        <big>This includes:</big>
        <p>
          - Bible calls for the separation of faithful Christians from the
          apostate Church symbolized as the fallen Babylon the Great.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revelations 18:1-5 1 And after these things I saw another angel come
          down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with
          his glory.  2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying,
          Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation
          of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every
          unclean and hateful bird.  3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of
          the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have
          committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are
          waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
        </p>
        <p>
          4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my
          people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not
          of her plagues.  5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath
          remembered her iniquities.
        </p>
        <p>
          - The reformation movements that gave rise to more denominations and
          further apostasies which is the reason the symbolic Babylon is called
          the mother of all harlots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revelations 17:4-6 4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet
          colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a
          golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her
          fornication:  5 and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY,
          BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE
          EARTH.  6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints,
          and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I
          wondered with great admiration.
        </p>
        <p>Lesson on reformers will feature some reformers like:</p>
        <p>
          Martin Luther of Lutheran Church, John Calvin of Presbyterian Church,
          John Smith of Baptist Church, John Wesley of Methodist Church and some
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The restoration movements that eventually restored the New Testament
          Church in names, worship, organization, etc.
        </p>
        <p>This will include movements championed by the likes of:</p>
        <p>
          Thomas Campbell and his son Alexander Campbell, J.W. Stone, Abner
          Jones, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>CONCLUSION:</h2>
        <p>
          Not knowing the history of the true church will make it difficult to
          identify and reject false prophets and false churches because all
          denominational churches and all human invented doctrines are not
          approved by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 John 4:1,6 1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
          whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into
          the world. ... 6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he
          that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth,
          and the spirit of error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathew 15:8-9 8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
          honoureth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me. 9 But in
          vain they do worship me, Teaching for doctrines the commandments of
          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restoration therefore entails that we should employ people to reject
          religious divisions or denominations and embrace unity of all true
          believers both in fellowship and doctrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke 11:23 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth
          not with me scattereth.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is because, on the last day judgement, a lot of churches or
          professing Christians will be rejected by Christ according to what he
          already said as shown below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathew 7:21-23 21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
          enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
          Father which is in heaven.  22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord,
          Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast
          out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  23 And then
          will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that
          work iniquity.
