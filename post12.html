        <big>Memory Verse</big>
        <p>
          Acts 2:43-46 <br />
          43And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done
          by the apostles. 44And all that believed were together, and had all
          things common; 45and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them
          to all men, as every man had need. 46And they, continuing daily with
          one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did
          eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
        </p></BR>
        <big>INTRODUCTION</big><BR>
        <p>
            Christianity is a religion of people who have had a new birth into a new family. They are further bonded with one Spirit that binds them together as 1 Corinthians 12:13 says: 
            “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.”
            As children of the same mother are nursed and fed with the same breast milk, it is the same way that Christians are made to drink into one spirit.
            The design for the Christian Church is that they should be seen in every community the Church exists as a family with the same Father, the same family philosophy, the same purpose and the same love. The early Christians largely lived like except for a few problematic ones. This study is therefore aimed to remind us about the mind of God concerning intra-Christian relationship.
            </p><br>
        <big>CONGREGATIONS ARE NOT TO ALLOW DISAFFECTIONS EXIST BECAUSE IT KILLS THE ESSENCE AND SPIRIT OF CHRISTIANITY AMONG THEM</big><br>
        <p>The church is admonished not to allow things that cause disaffection to exist among them. Measures must be taken immediately to curb such trends. Euodias and Syntyche were having relationship problems and were comfortable staying away from each other but they were admonished to live with each other as happy and loving sisters.
        Root of bitterness should not exist in our hearts against each other. This defiles our hearts and makes the Holy Spirit to depart from our lives and leave us as empty and defiled Christians.
        </p>
        <p> Hebrews 12:14-15 <br>
            14Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: 15looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;</p>
        <br>
        <big>THERE MUST BE EQUITY IN OUR SENSE OF JUDGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTIONS</big><br>
        <p>The church must exhibit one heart and openness to all members in everything. Make sure that everyone is given equal opportunity to benefit in everything. Even in duty assignments, give everyone opportunity to serve in the areas of his peculiar gifts. Don’t sideline anyone in distribution of anything.  <br><br>
            Acts 6:1 <br>
            1And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. <br> <br>
            1 Corinthians 12:4-7 <br>
            4Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 6And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 7But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</p>
        <br>
        <big>CONGREGATIONS ARE TO TREAT ALL MEMBERS WITH EQUAL RESPECT  DESPITE GIVING HONOUR TO WHOM HONOUR IS DUE
        </big> <br>
        <p>Even though the word of God recognises that there are individual inequalities in various ways in every group of people including the Church, he said that we shouldn’t make such inequalities to be pronounced in our Christian community. Giving honour to whom honour is due doesn’t require giving dishonour to whom it is due. The Christian community must share love evenly among members no matter their social standings in the society. No one should be slighted for his poverty or lack of education or for any other reason. Everyone’s countenance must be lifted by making them feel happy and honoured. <br><br>

            James 2:1-4 <br>
            1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. 2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 3 and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 4 are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
            <br><br>
            1 Timothy 5:21 <br>
            21 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.
            </p><br>
            <big>CONCLUSION</big>
            <br>
            <p>
            Christianity witnessed high and rapid growth in the early period not necessarily because of the miracles that existed that time but primarily because of the kind of love and oneness that existed among the Christians at that time. They saw themselves as one family and one tribe. We can do the same today.
