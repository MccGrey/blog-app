          Text: Ephesians 4:26-27 <br />26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the
          sun go down upon your wrath:  27 neither give place to the devil.
          <br /><br />
          INTRODUCTION <br />
          Anger is a natural phenomenon and so comes naturally when the heart is
          provoked. We cannot stop it from coming and that is why we are
          permitted to be angry as seen in our text above. As Christians, we are
          instructed to exercise self control in all things and that includes
          over anger. Proverbs 15:8 <br />A wrathful man stirreth up strife:
          But he that is slow to Anger appeaseth strife.<br /><br />
          Proverbs 16:32<br />
          He that is slow to Anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth
          his spirit than he that taketh a city. <br />It is because anger is
          manageable that we are given additional instructions not to sin when
          angry or give place to the devil. (Eph. 4:26-27) This means that we
          have so many options when we are angry: either to obey God’s command
          on anger or behave like people that don’t have or know God. Whatever
          we choose to do when angry shows our true identity because not all who
          profess God knows God. <br /><br />WHY WE MUST MANAGE ANGER
          <br />Anger in the heart of a man is like a volcano in the ground
          which is extremely hot and gaseous and waiting to erupt. If let out,
          it devours everything on its way. The difference between volcano and
          anger is that volcano is natural and so not regulated. In the case of
          anger, its eruption or otherwise is decided by the man in whose heart
          it burns. That is why God wants us to manage anger. We therefore
          manage anger for the following reasons:<br /><br />
          Because anger makes us vulnerable to sin We are vulnerable to sin when
          we are angry. This is because, nothing good comes from anger. All that
          we do or say out of anger are never in tandem with the spirit of
          holiness. <br />James 1:19-20 19<br />
          Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow
          to speak, slow to wrath:  20 for the wrath of man worketh not
          the righteousness of God. Those that have conscience usually live to
          regret most of the things they did or said when they were angry but
          some without conscience don’t border.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because a child of God must avoid sin at all cost The problem is that
          some Christians think that what constitute sin are only such things
          like fornication or adultery, stealing, lying, worshipping idols, etc.
          They don’t count malicious words, evil speaking, grudge, etc as sins.
          Those are such things that usually come from anger. The real children
          of God must consciously avoid sins that come from anger.<br /><br />
          1 John 5:18-20 18 <br />We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth
          not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked
          one toucheth him not...

          EXAMPLES OF POUR ANGER MANAGEMENT<br />
          Poor anger management has led some prominent bible characters to
          grievous mistakes. Some of them are Cain, Moses and Absalom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cain<br />
          Despite God warning Cain in advance that sin laid on his door, Cain
          still went ahead to murder his brother Cain because he couldn’t
          overcome his anger.
          <br />
          Genesis 4:5-7<br />
          5 but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was
          very wroth, and his countenance fell.  6 And the LORD said unto Cain,
          Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?  7 If thou
          doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well,
          sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou
          shalt rule over him
        </p>
        <p>
          Moses<br />
          Moses was provoked to the core by the children of Israel but there is
          no justification for sin. Because of anger, he lacked the composure to
          do exactly as God commanded him and struck the rock instead of
          speaking to it.
          <br />
          Numbers 20:7-12<br />
          7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  8 Take the rod, and gather
          thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye
          unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water,
          and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou
          shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.  9 And Moses took
          the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. 10 And Moses and
          Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said
          unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this
          rock?  11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the
          rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation
          drank, and their beasts also. 12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and
          Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the
          children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation
          into the land which I have given them.
          <br />
          <br />
          Moses' anger may be justifiable but that is not an excuse for
          misbehaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Absalom<br />
          Absalom harboured anger in his heart against his brother Amnon for a
          whole two years without saying any bad thing to him until he had
          killed him for defiling Tamar his sister.
          <br /><br />
          2 Samuel 13:20-29<br />
          .... 22 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
          for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. 23
          And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
          sheepshearers in Baal- hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom
          invited all the kings sons....
        </p>
        <p>
          Contemporary Examples<br />
          We have numerous contemporary examples of people who killed their
          wives like Osinachi’s husband who was accused to have killed his wife.
          We numerous knowledge of similar events in Nigeria. Wive killing
          husband, son killing father, friend killing friend, etc.<br />
          Even when killing is not involved, other ugly things happen. That is
          why we shouldn’t allow the sun to go down on our anger as God has
          commanded but unfortunately, some Christians have carried anger in
          their hearts against their brethren for longer than Absalom. We may
          not have physically murdered our brother like Absalom and Cain but
          we’re not in better status from theirs because Jesus said this:<br /><br />Matthew
          5:21-22<br />
          21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shalt not
          kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  22
          but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a
          cause shall be in danger of the judgment:
          <br /><br />
          EXAMPLES OF GOOD ANGER MANAGEMENT<br />
          We have several examples of good anger management in the bible but I
          will mention just two.
          <br />
          Esau<br />Jacob took away Esau’s blessings as the firstborn but when
          he came back with his family, servants and great wealth to Mamre. He
          feared the worst from Esau but Esau’s action showed good management of
          anger.<br />Genesis 33:3-4<br />
          3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the
          ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.  4 And Esau ran
          to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him:
          and they wept.<br /><br />
          Joseph<br />Joseph had opportunity to take his own pound of flesh from
          his brothers who plotted to kill him but later sold him to
          Ishmaelites. When they mourned for their error on realising that
          Joseph is now a governor in Egypt and their host, Joseph shocked them
          with words of consolation and comfort.<br /><br />Genesis 45:4-5<br />
          4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And
          they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold
          into Egypt.  5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with
          yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to
          preserve life.<br /><br />HOW TO CONTROL ANGER<br />It is simple to
          control anger. There are two easiest steps to control anger.<br />The
          first step is to say nothing when you are angry<br /><br />Psalm
          39:1-2<br />
          1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue:
          I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me. 2 I
          was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow
          was stirred.<br /><br />The second step is not to prolong the
          anger.<br />Ephesians 4:26-27<br />26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let
          not the sun go down upon your wrath:  27 neither give place to the
          devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          CONCLUSION<br /><br />As Christians, we should have the ability to
          bring our emotions under control.<br /><br />

          Proverbs 19:11<br />
          The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; And it is his glory to
          pass over a transgression. When a Christian applies discretion in his
          emotions, it helps him to avoid sins that usually come with anger.
