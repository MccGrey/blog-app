        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>In the book of Isaiah Isaiah 12:2-3, we read:
        </p>
        <p>- “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. 3  Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.”
        </p>
        <p>- What is God to you. How can you evaluate your love and relationship with God?
        </p>
        <h2>TO DAVID, GOD WAS EVERYTHING</h2>
        <p>God was everything to the young David and whenever David called him in trouble, his answer shook the earth.
        </p>
        <p>2 Samuel 22:1-10  <br>
            <p>1  And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: 2  And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; 3  The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. 
            </p>
            <p>1  And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: 2  And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; 3  The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. 
            </p>
            <p>8  Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth. 9  There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. 10  He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.
            </p>
            <h2>IT SERVES YOU NOTHING TO BE RELIGIOUS BUT WITHOUT GOD IN YOUR LIFE</h2>
            <p>Amos 5:18  Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.
            </p>
            <p>James 4:8  Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
            </p>
            <p>Eli was the High Priest in Israel but could no longer hear the voice of God when he spoke. God turned to the inexperienced young Samuel what he intended to do. (1 Samuel 3:7-12)  Can you still hear the voice of the Spirit of God in your life?
            </p>
            <p>King Saul still carried the anointing of God with him but the Spirit of God had abandoned him with his anointing. (1 Samuel 16:14) Truly you received baptism but is the Holy Spirit still ruling your life?
            </p>
            <h2>THERE ARE CHRISTIANS TO WHOM GOD IS EVERYTHING</h2>
            <p>- They can’t move without God.
            </p>
            <p>- They can’t speak without God.
            </p>
            
            <p>- They can’t transact business without God.
            </p>
            <p>- They can’t go into a relationship without God.
            </p>
            <p>- They can’t decide things without God.
            </p>
            <p>- They can’t choose a career without God.
            </p>
            <p>- They can’t resolve conflicts without God.
            </p>
            <p>- They put God first in every thing they do.
            </p>
            <p>- They don’t live for themselves but for God.
            </p>
            <h2>GREAT MEN AND WOMEN OF THE BIBLE TO WHOM GOD WAS EVERYTHING</h2>
            <big>WHAT DOES GOD MEAN TO YOU?
            </big>
            <p>ABEL: God meant everything to Abel that he was happy to sacrifice the best of everything to him. Are you willing to sacrifice your best to God? (Genesis 4:4)
            </p>
            <p>
                ENOCH: God meant everything to Enoch that he feared Him greatly in the midst of a lawless pre-flood society. Are you ready to retain the fear of God in the midst of ungodly people? (Genesis 5:24)
                </p>
                <p>NOAH: God meant everything to Noah that he was able to be perfect in the midst of lawless pre-flood society. Can you walk with God when others have chosen to live their life their own way. (Genesis 6:9)
                </p>
                <p>LOT: God meant everything to Lot’s family that he was able to raise his daughter’s as virgins in the midst of lesbians and gays. Can your righteousness blossom in a cursed society? (2 Peter 2:7-8)
                </p>
                <p>ABRAHAM: God meant everything to Abraham that he was willing to sacrifice his only son and only child to him. Can you withdraw from God’s service just because of your children? (Genesis 22:1-3)
                </p>
                <p>
                    JACOB: God meant everything to Jacob that even in his death bed, he still confessed him as the one who has kept and fed him all his days? Do you accredit every bit of your fortune to God or to luck? (Genesis 48:15)
                    </p>
                    <p>JOSEPH:  God meant everything to Joseph that even in a strange land, he offered to go to prison than to offend God. Do you prefer your own safety than your relationship with God? (Genesis 39:7-9)
                    </p>
                    <p>MOSES:  God meant everything to Moses that he valued belonging to the family of God than to be an heir of the Kingdom of Egypt. (Hebrews 11:23-25)
                    </p>
                    <p>PHINEHAS:  God meant everything to Phinehas that he couldn’t condole a disrespect to God by Zimri and Cozbi the Midianite woman. (Numbers 25:10-15)
                    </p>
                    <p>JEPHTHAH:  God meant everything to Jephthah that he preferred to sacrifice his only daughter than to break his vow to God. Are you willing to withdraw from your promise to God momentarily in the face of difficulty? (Judges 11:35)
                    </p>
                    <p>DAVID:  God meant everything to David that he decided to fight the war of God as an untrained soldier against a military giant and champion. Are you willing to take up a challenge for God against your own safety? (1 Samuel 17:45)
                    </p>
                    <p>JOSIAH:  God meant everything to King Josiah of Judah that though his grandfather Manasseh was evil and his own father Amon that brought him up was evil, yet denounced their evil way and cleaved to God as an eighth year old king. Are you willing to breakout of your unfaithful family to serve God faithfully? (2 Kings 21:19-24, 22:1-10)
                    </p>
                    <p>SHEDRACH, MESHACH AND ABADNEGO:  God meant everything to Shedrach, Meshach and Abadnego that they were willing to be thrown into fire alive than to momentarily worship King Nebuchadnezzar’s God. Are you willing to denounce authorities just to please God? (Daniel 3:16-18)
                    </p>
                    <p>WIDOW IN THE TEMPLE:  God meant everything to widow that gave everything she had to God in the temple. Do you value God more than all your riches? (Mark 12:41-44)
                    </p>
                    <p>PETER AND JOHN:  God meant everything to Peter and John that when they were beaten for preaching in the name of Jesus, instead of being sad they celebrated being beaten because of Jesus. Are you willing to endure insults before of God? (Acts 5:40-41)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        PAUL:  God meant everything to Paul that when a prophecy was released about his afflictions in Jerusalem, he was rather eager to enjoy suffering and being killed for Jesus. Do you love Jesus even when your life is at stake? (Acts 21:13)
                        </p> <br><br><br>
                        <p>Today, you have the opportunity to make a mark on earth for God but I ask again, “WHAT DOES GOD MEAN TO YOU?”
