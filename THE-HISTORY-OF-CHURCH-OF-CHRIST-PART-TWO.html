        <big>TOPIC: APOSTASY – A THEMATIC ANALYSIS</big><br />
        <p>
          2 Thessalonians 2:1-3,7  <br />
          3 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
          Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, 2  That ye be not soon
          shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by
          letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. 3  Let no man
          deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there
          come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of
          perdition. … 7  For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he
          who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>INTRODUCTION:</big><br />
        <p>
          We have been taking a series of studies on the Establishment, Apostasy
          and Restoration of the Christian Church. We focused on the
          establishment of the Church in the previous quarter which x-rayed
          various prophecies concerning the establishment of the Christian
          Church and the eventual establishment of the church. In this quarter,
          we shall be looking at the History of Church Apostasy (Falling away
          from the New Testament pattern of Christianity) and our next quarter
          theme will focus on Reformation and Restoration Movements. Our
          references will be to the Bible primarily and then, to the book, ‘The
          Eternal Kingdom: A History Of The Church Of Christ’ by F.W. Mattox,
          PhD who was The President of Lubbock Christian College Lubbock, Texas.
          His book is largely based on the History of the Christian Church by
          Eusebius who recorded his historical account of the Christian Church
          around the fourth Century AD and who was an eyewitness of most of the
          accounts he recorded.<br /><br />
          The study will also look into some symbolic representations of some of
          the events of Church apostasy in the Book of Revelations such as the
          Dragon, the seven-headed beast and the harlot that rides on the back
          of the seven-headed beast, the lamb-like beast that speaks like a
          dragon which made an image for the previous seven-headed beast and
          caused the people to worship that previous beast whose wounds now
          seemed to be healed. We shall try to link these symbols to the actual
          historical events.<br /><br />
          Having this general overview about the Christian Church will help
          solidify our understanding of Christian religion and this study is
          very important for every professing Christian whether you are a member
          of Church of Christ or not. The study will x-ray events that happened
          in and around the Christian church from as early as the first century
          AD. The chronicles of post-apostolic events will be studied and these
          include the internal and external forces that troubled the Church in
          these early periods, the blackmail of the Christian Church by Nero
          which sparked up the early resentments towards the church and the
          subsequent severe state persecutions that followed. It will also
          highlight some early deviations from New Testament pattern and look
          into the influence of Constantine which led to the merger of the
          church with the pagan state of Rome called the Roman Empire which
          turned the church into an empirical church that became the official
          reference point of Church Apostasy. The key doctrinal deviations and
          the early resistance by various individuals and groups and the second
          round of persecutions in form of Crusades by then Romanized empirical
          church will also be discussed.<br /><br />

          The next quarter will x-ray efforts of some prominent individuals or
          groups that moved to reform the apostate Roman empirical church and
          how some of them ended up being killed or exiled while some of them
          also ended up forming new religious groups with yet the same doctrinal
          deviations rather than seeking to restore the original church from
          which Roman Empirical Church was formed. It will also look into the
          restoration movements that eventually restored the New Testament
          church in accordance to the call in Revelations 18:4 which says, “And
          I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people,
          that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
          plagues.” The restoration will be in areas of names or designations,
          organizational system, mode of membership, worship pattern and other
          key religious beliefs and practices.<br /><br />
          Remember that the Holy Spirit spoke in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 thus “for
          that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first”. It
          is evident that this prophecy has been fulfilled a long time ago and
          the onus on every professing Christian to study and know on which side
          of Christianity he is in: The Apostate Church or The Restored
          Church.<br /><br />
          In this thematic analysis, we should ask some basic questions: What is
          Apostasy, why did it happen and why did God allow it to happen in his
          church?
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>WHAT IS APOSTASY?</big><br />
        <p>
          Advanced English Dictionary defines APOSTASY in two related ways as
          follow: <br />
          1. The state of having rejected your religious beliefs or your
          political party or a cause (often in favour of opposing beliefs or
          causes). <br />
          <br />
          2. The act of abandoning a party for a cause. <br />
          <br />
          These are the ways the English Dictionary defines the term APOSTASY.
          In addition to the above definitions, Bible defines apostasy as
          “FALLING AWAY OR DEPARTURE FROM THE FAITH OR BEING DRAWN AWAY INTO
          HERESY”. <br />
          <br />
          2 Thessalonians 2:3   <br />
          Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,
          except there come a falling away first… <br />
          1 Timothy 4:1-2  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
          times some shall depart from the faith…, giving heed to seducing
          spirits, and doctrines of devils. <br />
          2 Peter 2:1-3   <br />
          1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
          shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable
          heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon
          themselves swift destruction. 2  And many shall follow their
          pernicious ways… <br />
          <br />

          All the above prophecies show that apostasy from the true Christian
          Faith was not an accident at all. God knew about it before it
          happened. God warned us adequately about it in the so those that would
          ignore his warnings and fall victims will meet God in judgment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>WHY DID APOSTASY HAPPEN?</big><br />
        <p>
          There are many possible factors that made apostasy possible but let us
          mention but a few:  Love for self-pleasure: Quest for leisure does
          not allow people to choose between religious entertainments or
          fantasies and true worship. This makes it easy for them to accept any
          teaching so far it comes with material comfort.<br /><br />
          2 Timothy 3:1-2 <br /> This know also, that in the last days perilous
          times shall come. 2  For men shall be lovers of their own selves,
          covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
          unthankful, unholy, (also see Ephesians 5:19, Hebrews 13:15) Ephesians
          4:14 <br /> That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro,
          and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men,
          and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;<br /><br />

           Quest for materialism:<br /><br />
          People’s urge to get rich quickly and miraculously has made them not
          to pay attentions to bible doctrines but to motivational speeches that
          promise them wealth and earthly success. Quest to make money also
          pushes many religious leaders into floating privately owned churches
          that will give them absolute control and access to church money. When
          a greedy man meets a greedy man, the result is unspeakably ugly
          Philippians 3:18-19<br />
           (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
          weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: 19  Whose
          end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in
          their shame, who mind earthly things.) . (also see Romans 16:16-18)
          <br /><br />
          Hardness of Hearts:<br /><br />
          2 Timothy 4:3-4  For the time will come when they will not endure
          sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to
          themselves teachers, having itching ears; 4  And they shall turn away
          their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. (also see
          2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)<br /><br />
           Satan’s quest to push men to hellfire.<br /><br />
          Revelation 12:12<br />
           Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the
          inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down
          unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a
          short time. (also see 1 Peter 5:8)
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>WHY DID GOD ALLOW APOSTASY TO HAPPEN TO HIS CHURCH?</big>
        <br />
        <p>
          God created man with the freedom to will. That was why He put the Tree
          of Life in the Garden of Eden and also the Tree of Knowledge of Good
          and Evil and commanded Adam not to eat from the later tree. God wanted
          them to have the freedom to make their own choices so they would be
          responsible for any path they chose for themselves.<br /><br />
          It is the same thing with our generation. No one is forced into
          apostasy. Everyone has the power of will to accept or reject
          deviations from the Word of God. In early days of Roman Catholic, Pope
          ordered the killings of some Christians that rejected his authority
          and those disciples were willing to die than to submit to the Pope.<br /><br />
          Apostasy was not brought by God but by Satan. People are encouraged to
          study the word of God in order not to fall prey of Satan’s antics but
          not many of them are willing to listen. This apostasy will show those
          who are truly loyal to God and those that are rebellious, who would
          willfully abandon the commandments of God because of their own
          material lusts and pleasures. God always allows people to make their
          own choices so they will be fully responsible for their actions.<br /><br />
          Philippians 2: <br />…work out your own salvation with fear and
          trembling.<br />
          Matthew 16:27 <br /> For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his
          Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according
          to his works.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE THINGS WE SHALL COVER IN THIS THEME</big><br />
        <p>
          THE STATE OF THE CHURCH BEFORE APOSTASY:-<br />
          This will help us know the internal and external forces trying to
          destabilize the church prior to eventual apostasy. (2 Corinthians 7:5,
          1 John 2:18-19) <br /><br />
          PROPHECIES CONCERNING THE APOSTASY:-<br />
          This will help us know various prophecies and warnings that were given
          to early Christians to prepare their minds for the eventual
          persecutions that would come upon the church which would ultimately
          lead to other issues that paved the way for departures from the New
          Testament Christian religious system into a compromised Christian
          religious system. (Revelations 1:1) <br /><br />
          <big
            >UNDERSTANDING THE PROPHECY ABOUT THE COMING OF THE MAN OF SIN IN 2
            THESSALONIANS 2:1-4 AND THE STRATEGIC IMPACT HIS EMERGENCE WOULD
            HAVE ON THE GLOBAL CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY:-</big
          ><br /><br />
          This will help us know about the emergence of a singular highest
          Christian religious office that would have all churches submit to his
          authority as an overall person in the church whose rule would lead the
          church into damnable perdition.<br /><br />
          <big>
            UNDERSTANDING THE VISION OF THE BEASTS AND THE PROSTITUTE:-<br /><br /></big
          ><br /><br />
          This will help us to understand the symbolic representations of Satan
          who transferred his throne and power to the empire that ruled the
          world at that time who in turn transferred that same throne and power
          to the religious empire that replaced it and would make his collapsed
          empire to become relevant again through religion. (Rev. 12, 13, 17,
          18)
          <big
            ><br /><br />FROM PERSECUTION TO AN ILLUSIONARY PEACE (NOT VICTORY,
            BUT A CHANGE OF TACTICS):-<br /><br
          /></big>
          This will examined how the church was severely persecuted to stamp it
          out and how the perseverance of the church led to the Edict of Milan.
          (Revelations 13:7)
          <big
            ><br /><br />THE UNHOLY UNION: (THE INFLUENCE OF CONSTANTINE AND THE
            CHURCH’S MERGER WITH THE ROMAN STATE):-<br /><br
          /></big>
          This will tell us how Constantine’s merger of the Church with
          idol-worshipping Roman Empire gave the church the final blow of
          doctrinal and organizational compromise which is the actual apostasy
          the prophecies about falling away from the faith point to.
          (Revelations 18:1-5)
          <big
            ><br /><br />SOME KEY DEPARTURES FROM THE ORIGINAL FAITH BY NOW
            APOSTATE CHURCH:- <br /><br /></big
          >This will highlight some of the major or key departures from the New
          Testament doctrines and practices in the areas of Salvation (infant
          and sprinkling baptism), areas of church organization (formation of
          Parishes and overall one-man rule), areas of eternity (creation of a
          false second chance after death in form of Purgatory, Penance, Sale of
          indulgence, etc.), in the area of church officers (enacting of the law
          of celibacy, special robes for the clergy, creation of unscriptural
          titles, etc.), (1 timothy 4:1-3) 
          <big
            ><br /><br />THE CRUSADES: CRUSHING OF OPPOSITIONS TO THE AUTHORITY
            OF THE ROMAN PONTIFF:-</big
          ><br /><br />
          This will discuss some of key crusades and executions of people and
          groups that opposed the authority of the Roman Pontiff and other
          doctrinal practices of the empirical Church. Some were burnt alive,
          some were massacred, some were exiled and had their properties
          confiscated just the same way the earlier Roman Emperors persecuted
          the early church before Edict of Milan. (Revelation 13:11-12, 17)
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>CONCLUSION</big><br />
        <p>
          Every disciple of Christ is encouraged to examine himself to be sure
          that he belongs to the true faith.<br /><br />
          2 Corinthians 13:5  <br />
          Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.
          Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except
          ye be reprobates?<br /><br />
          1 John 4:1  <br />
          Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they
          are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the
          world.<br /><br />
          2 Timothy 2:15  <br />
          Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to
          be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<br /><br />

          How could you know the true faith from the apostate faith if you don’t
          study the history of the Church and contrast it with the plain bible
          teachings? Join us on Sundays from July 9 th to August 24 th as we
          take this journey into the past to know what gave rise to countless
          denominations with unscriptural doctrines and practices.
