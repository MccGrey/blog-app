        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>We have come to the last quarter of our studies on the History of Church of Christ from its establishment around 33AD to its restoration in the 18th Century. Our focus on this quarter will be on the Reformation and Restoration Movements. This will enable us see the highlights of contributions made by various Reformers to restore the apostate Roman Catholic Church to the original New Testament Church from which they deviated. 
        </p>
        <p>It will also highlight the contributions of Restorers who heeded God’s call to come out from the fallen symbolic Babylon and not to continue to take part in her sins and spiritual adultery. We shall see how those heroes of restoration movement laboured to restore the New Testament Church in designations, organization, worship, life and creed that today, we can truly boast of a church that truly belongs to Christ and completely practices his doctrines.

        </p>
        <p>We shall also see some the erroneous doctrines and practices that required to be restored to their original Scriptural patterns and their eventual restorations.
        </p>
        <p>The Month of October will focus on the Reformation and Restoration movements and will be a combined class while the months of November and December will focus on the study of the restored doctrines and practices of the New Testament and these will be studied in various departmental classes.  Today’s class will explain the terms ‘Reformation Movements’ and ‘Restoration Movements’. This will help us understand the difference(s) between Reformation Movement and Restoration Movement vis-à-vis God’s instruction for his people to come out from the fallen symbolic Babylon.

        <br />
        <h2>MEANING OF REFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Advanced English Dictionary defines REFORMATION in three ways as:
        </p>
        <p>1. Improvement or an intended improvement in the existing form or condition of institutions or practices, etc.; intended to make striking change for the better in social or political or religious affairs.
        </p>
        <p>2. A religious movement of the 16th century that began as an attempt to reform Roman Catholic Church and resulted in the creation of Protestant churches.
        </p>
        <p>3. Rescuing from error and returning to a rightful course.
        </p>
        <p>The above are definitions of the term – Reformation by the Advanced English Dictionary. These English definitions will help us understand the state of Christianity is some periods in history that prompted reformation attempts and marry them with the Bible prophecies to fully understand the message God is trying to pass to us in many Bible passages which will help us to reject religious errors and embrace the truth.
        </p>
        <h2>WHAT IS REFORMATION MOVEMENT?</h2>
        <p>This refers to efforts made by various individuals (Clergy and Laity) in Roman Catholic Church and later in Anglican Church to improve the church in terms of manner of life, practices and doctrines to conform to the original New Testament patterns. Why these efforts became efforts in futility is that the church being reformed was already dead without the Spirit of God which is the Spirit of Truth. It has been alienated from Christ through various doctrinal and organizational perversions and worship of idols, worship of angels,  worship of Sun-god in the guise of blessed sacrament and worship of dead men and women who they call Saints. This is why the apostate Church  is called a great whore and mother of all harlots. 
        </p>
        <p>“For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.” (Revelation 19:2)
        </p>
        <p>Just like the Book of Job says, “No one can bring a clean thing out of an unclean; (Job 14:4), it is impossible to restore the apostate Roman Church back to the New Testament church. The state of their departure from the faith is so strong that the Holy Spirit describes their attitude under apostasy as having their conscience seared with a hot iron and not receiving the love of the truth but having pleasure in unrighteousness. How can anyone reform such a body?
        </p>
        <p>“1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 2  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.” (1 Timothy 4:1-2)
        </p>
        <p>“9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 10  And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11  And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 12  That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)
        </p>
        <p>It was a hopeless condition that was irreversible and that was why the Reformers failed in their bid to reform the apostate Roman Church. It is very clear from the above Scriptures that God already knew that nobody could return the apostate Roman Church to the original form because of their level of delusion hence, he commands the faithful remnants to come out of her and be separate instead. (Revelation 18:4)
        </p><p>The apostate church is likened unto the fallen natural Babylon because the natural Babylon was destroyed and never rebuilt again at the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>“Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. … 5  Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms. 13  Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. …14  Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.” (Isaiah 47:1,5,13 &14)
        </p>
        <p>The fall of natural Babylon was final and permanent, the same way, the spiritual Babylon has fallen and never to be rebuilt which was why the call from God is for the true worshippers to come out of her because what awaits her is the final judgment for all her whoredom, all the blood of the martyrs  she shed, the ones she burnt alive on the stakes, etc. She will receive double fold measures of her wickedness and abominations.
        </p>
        <p>“5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 6  Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double….” (Revelation 18:5-6) See Revelations 18:5-20 for the final Judgment on Rome. 
        </p><p>“And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. 2  And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. 3  For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. 4  And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” (Rev. 18:1-4)
        </p>
        <p>The Reformers therefore laboured in vain to reform an ‘unreformable’ church. The Roman Church was corrupted beyond reformation. What can anybody reform in the Roman Catholic Church? Can anybody remove the office of Pope? Dismantle Diocese system? Remove priestly system? Stop celibacy and asceticism?  Change baptism to immersion and adults only? Remove all idols of Jesus, angels and dead saints? Remove doctrines of Purgatory, Penance, Transubstantiation, etc.? Close down the Vatican as headquarters as the true church only has heavenly headquarters where Jesus – the Head is?

          </div>
          <h2>MEANING OF RESTORATION</h2>
          <p>Advanced English Dictionary defines RESTORATION in seven ways but let us choose a few:
        </p>
        <p>1. Getting something back again.
        </p>
        <p>2. The state of being restored to its former good condition.
        </p>
        <p>3. A model that represents the landscape of a former geological age or that represents an extinct animal, etc.
        </p>
        <p>With the above dictionary definitions, we can easily understand the vision of the champions of the Restoration Movement in contrast with those of the Reformation Movement. As the Reformers largely decided to remain in the apostate church and change it from within, the Restorers were more direct and purposeful.  
        </p>
        <p>Understanding these two key periods in Christian history will open the horizon for purposeful bible studies which will help us to understand that God only wants perfect Christian unity in doctrines and practices rather than denominations with varying and contradicting doctrines and practices which are only loosely connected through socio-political unions and associations such as Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Scripture Union, etc. God wants Unity in Christianity and not Union  
        </p>
        <h2>WHAT IS RESTORATION MOVEMENT?</h2>
        <p>This refers to efforts made by different individuals from different denominational churches to unite all Christians into a common faith as given in the Bible from which the apostate church departed. 
        </p>
        <p>“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” (1 Timothy 4:1)
        </p>
        <p>“Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.” (Jude 1:3)
        </p>
        <p>It was the above instruction of Contending for the original  Faith that the Restorers obeyed. To contend for that Faith, one needs to also heed the call in Revelations 18:4 which says,
        </p>
        <p>“And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins.” 
        </p>
        <h2>RESTORATION ACHIEVED</h2>
        <p>Because of the efforts of those great men, we have the Church today as it was in the early period of Christianity before the apostasy. Today, we have a church called the Church of Christ or Church of God again; today, we have a church that is not globally, nationally or regionally ruled by one man; today, we have a church that worships according to the New Testament pattern; today, we have a church that takes the Bible as the only rule of Faith without additional creeds or articles of Faith. 
        </p>
        <p>Today, Satan has failed to permanently bury the New Testament Christianity; today, we can worship God again in Spirit and Truth without adulterated doctrines as created by uninspired men. We can only show gratitude to God for leading us to the Truth and freeing us from religious bondage, blindness and errors.   
        </p>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>We must celebrate the Reformers as well as the Restorers because the Reformers laid the foundations the Restorers built on. The reformers spoke when speaking was forbidden by the apostate Roman Church and translated the Bible when it was a capital offence to do so. Majority of the Reformers gave their lives to make the eventual works of the Restorers easier. That is why the Bible says:
        </p>
        <p>“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.” (Romans 8:28)
        </p>
        <p>Next week, we shall look at the summaries of the works of each of the Reformers.
