          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p>
          Having known that crusade in our study context refers to a holy war, our study is not going to focus on various political wars of the Roman Catholic Church against Muslims and other external forces but the crusades the Roman Catholic Church carried out against Christian oppositions to the authority of the Pope and Roman Catholic doctrines in the guise of fighting heresies.

          <h2>THE ORIGIN OF CRUSADES</h2> 
          <p>
          - In November 1095AD, at the Council of Clermont in southern France, Pope Urban called on Western Christians to take up arms to aid the Byzantines and recapture the Holy Land from Muslim control. This marked the beginning of the Crusades.

          <br /><br />
          - Pope Urban’s plea was met with a tremendous response, both among the military elite as well as ordinary citizens. Those who joined the armed pilgrimage wore a cross as a symbol of the Church.

          <br /><br />
          - The Crusades set the stage for several religious knightly military orders, including the knights Templar, the Teutonic Knights, and the Hospitallers. These groups defended the Holy Land and protected Christian pilgrims traveling to and from the region.

          <br /><br />
          - This set the stage for several crusades carried out by the Roman Catholic Church between 11th and 14th centuries.

          <h2>BACKGROUND OF CATHOLIC CRUSADES AGAINST CHRISTIAN OPPOSITIONS CONT….</h2>
          <p>
            - To carry out his plan, Bishop Cerularius closed the Latin churches and monasteries in Constantinople and he influenced Bishop Leo of Bulgaria to write a letter to the bishops of southern Italy in which he listed all the errors of the Roman Church. This action provoked Pope Leo IX (Bishop of Rome) and a bitter controversy arose between Rome and Constantinople. All the reconciliation talks between the two sides proved abortive and on July 16, 1054AD, the three papal legates (representatives) excommunicated the Bishop of Constantinople and the Eastern churches and placed the decree excommunicating them on the alter of the church in Sophia. Cerularius the Bishop of Constantinople  responded by excommunicating the Roman Pope and the Western Churches. This created the final break between the two sides. The Greek Eastern churches were called “The Holy Orthodox Church” while the Latin Western churches were called “Roman Catholic Church”. 

            <br /><br />
            - Further oppositions  to the authority of the Roman Pope and Roman Catholic doctrines among the Western churches received severe punishments of Executions, Massacre, Confiscation of property, etc. as highlighted below:

          <h2>THE ALBIGENSIANS OR CATHARS’ CRUSADE 1209-1229</h2>
          <p>
            - This was the first Crusade to specifically target perceived heretic Christians - the Cathars of southern France. The term Cathar is from the Greek word Katheros meaning “Pure” so the term Catharists refers to the opposition Christian groups that called themselves “The Pure Ones”, and by implication regarding other Catholic faithful as the polluted ones. 

            - From the ninth century onwards, there were glimpses of thousands of people who opposed the Roman hierarchy and were persecuted as heretics. such groups were mostly found in Greece, Germany, France and Holland and were variously identified by local names but  Catharists or Paulicians seem to be the general designations given them by the Roman hierarchy. In local and more restricted areas they were known by such names as Arnoldians, Paulicians, Petrobusians, Albigenses and Waldenses. Such local identities were mostly references to specific leader or location of each local group.  These were mostly executed by sword, by being burnt alive and by other gruesome methods.

          <h2>THE CRUSADE ON THE ALBIGENSES</h2>
          <p>This was arguably the bloodiest and the most brutal Christian massacre by a Roman Catholic Pope. Pope Innocent III will ever be remembered for this notoriety. In order to stir up hatred, special rewards as well as indulgences were promised by the Pope to everyone who would leave his occupation for forty days to join the war against the Albigenses. Multitudes accepted this opportunity to trade their services for the remission of sins promised them by the Pope. Others joined the papal army out of the desire for the loot that they would be permitted to take. From about 50,000 papal army, the number increased to about 300,000 because Catholics in southern France in order to save their own lives decided to sew the symbol of the cross on their clothing and joined the papal army to massacre their fellow indigenes. No one was spared: men, women, children, elderly, suckling, the pregnant, the maimed, etc.</p>

          <h2>A NARATOR’S ACCOUNT OF THE CRUSADE READS THUS:</h2>
          <p>“Hundreds of villages had seen all their inhabitants massacred with a blind fury, without the crusaders giving themselves the trouble to examine whether they contained a single heretic; the harvest of the country people and the provisions and merchandise of the citizens were divided at discretion among the marauding assailants. There was scarcely a peasant who did not reckon in his family some, unhappy one whose life had been out off by the sword of Montfort’s soldiers, and whose property had not been repeatedly ravaged. More than three quarters of the knights and lorded proprietors of the district had been dispossessed of their castles and Feifs.”
        </p>

        <p>Conservative estimates state that two-thirds of the people of Southern France were killed in the effort to wipe out the heresy of Albigensianism.
        </p>
        <h2>THE INQUISITION</h2>
        <p>The experience of Albigensians made the papacy to come up with an organization to deal with heresies. The Latern Council of 1215 which decreed that religious authorities would pass on individual orthoxy, and those found to be heretics would be turned over to the state officials for execution. 
<br>
            This institution grew to become an organization of terror. Any individual could accuse another person for heresy, and when the accused was called for trial he was not allowed to know who is his accuser was or to defend himself. The laws governing the Inquisition was incorporated into later additions of Corpus Juris as part of the canon law and are in force to the present day. The Inquisition was largely placed in the hands of the Dominican monks who were very zealous in the extermination of heresy. These monks were subject to no authority, civil or ecclesiastical, other than the Pope.
            <br>
            The Inquisition saw countless Christians executed by the sword or by being burnt alive under the Papal orders.
