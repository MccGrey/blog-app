          1 Peter 4:1-4 <br />

          1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
          yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in
          the flesh hath ceased from sin; 2 that he no longer should live the
          rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of
          God. 3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought
          the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts,
          excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 4
          wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same
          excess of riot, speaking evil of you:
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>OUR LIFE MUST BE ALTERED FOR A HIGHER LIVING</big><br />
        <p>
          He that wants to livei in heaven forever must first learn the heavenly
          lifestyle on earth. In Isaiah 55:8-9 we read: 8 For my thoughts are
          not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. 9For
          as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than
          your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.In Ezekiel 18:25, God
          sets the record straight to correct Israel's wrong impression
          concerning his way which Israel said were not equal by saying: Yet ye
          say, the way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is
          not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>INTRODUCTION</big>
        <p>
          A Christian lifestyle is a different realm of life and different world
          all together and that is why they are called “Church” which means
          “Called out”. Christians are called out from the world and that is why
          Jesus said, “but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen
          you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” (John 5:19) To
          be a real Christian, one must understand what Paul meant by the term
          “High Calling” in Philippians 3:14 where he said, “14I press toward
          the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”
          Heaven is possible but a higher life is required. One must begin to
          live out of self by defeating self desires and begin to walk on a
          higher ground of a Spirit-filled life. This is what Paul said he was
          pushing for in Philippians 3:7-15
        </p>
        <p>
          Philippians 3:7-15 <br />

          7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
          8Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of
          the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the
          loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,
          9and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of
          the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
          righteousness which is of God by faith: 10that I may know him, and the
          power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being
          made conformable unto his death; 11if by any means I might attain unto
          the resurrection of the dead. 12Not as though I had already attained,
          either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may
          apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
          13Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing
          I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth
          unto those things which are before, 14I press toward the mark for the
          prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. 15Let us therefore,
          as many as be perfect, be thus minded:

        <big>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE IS A HIGH WAY OF HOLINESS</big><br />
        <p>
          Isaiah 35:8-9<br />

          8 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The
          way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be
          for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. 9No
          lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it
          shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:

          >A CHRISTIAN MUST SUFFOCATE HIS NATURAL SELF TO BE SQUEEZED INTO THE
          NUMBER OF ACTUAL GOD’S CHILDREN</big
        ><br />
        <p>
          Zechariah 13:8-9<br />

          8 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two
          parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left
          therein. 9And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will
          refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried:
          they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my
          people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>CONCLUSION</big><br />
        <p>
          Brethren, we must lay down every weight that pulls our spiritual life
          down and set our focus on conforming to the nature of Christ. We must
          begin to live a higher level of life. We must show higher level in all
          aspects of our life: higher understanding, higher mentality, higher
          philosophy, higher attitude, higher wisdom, higher mercy, higher way
          of talking, higher way of doing everything. We must begin to walk on a
          HIGHER GROUND as we sing in our hymn books. Heaven is possible if we
          agree. <br />

          Hebrews 12:1-2 <br />

          1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud
          of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so
          easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
          before us, 2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith;
          who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising
          the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
