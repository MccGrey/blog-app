                The programme is run and sponsored by volunteers from Churches
                of Christ all over the world through an independent Media
                Evangelism Ministry named Family Bible Ministry.<br />

                The Anchor of the programme is Innocent Chukwudi Agu who has
                been a Media Evangelist of a long standing, having been the
                first Church of Christ Television Evangelism presenter in
                Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory, Abuja from 2010. Until
                today, he remains one of the presenters of the popular Let The
                Bible Speak Television programme on Independent Television (ITV)
                Abuja which is a programme sponsored by Churches of Christ in
                Abuja and its environs that airs every Saturday from 6:00pm to
                6:30pm.<br />

                Family Bible Ministry which owns this project also prints and
                distributes Bible-based Literatures, Movies, Hymns, etc. and
                welcomes donations from well-meaning Christians all over the
                world. Whatever you put into the preaching of the gospel of
                Christ is an investment in heaven whose reward must surely come.
                We will be glad to have you as our partner in the kingdom work.
                <br />
