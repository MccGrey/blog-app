        <big>INTRODUCTION</big><br />
        <p>
          In the book of Romans 8:32 we read: <br /><br />

          “He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
          shall he not with him also freely give us all things?”
        </p>
        <p>
          If God therefore spared not his own son but gave him up for us and is
          ready to freely give us all things, what should be too big for us to
          also sacrifice for his sake. This is the point of our today’s lesson.
          We can’t pretend not to be aware of disaffections of our immediate
          past. <br /><br />
          Today, we are rounding up our reconciliation message that started in
          October. I am also particularly happy for the reconciliations we have
          achieved between parties and individuals. As we plan to step into a
          new season, there is need for us to leave behind any remnant of
          ill-feelings, bitterness, grudges, hatred, suspicions, etc. Some may
          not have repented enough to deserve our forgiveness but if God did not
          spare his only son and gave him up for us, why can’t we for his sake
          forgive every offence against us? Can’t we make sacrifices for his
          sake? <br /><br />
          This lesson is to open our eyes and minds to the need to make
          sacrifices for the sake of God.
        </p>
        <br />

        <big>WHAT IS SACRIFICE?</big> <br />
        <p>
          Advanced English Dictionary defines Sacrifice in these ways: <br />
          <br />
          1. The act of loosing or surrendering something as a penalty for a
          mistake or fault or failure to perform, etc.<br />
          <br />
          2. Endure the loss of.<br />
          <br />
          3. A loss entailed by giving up or selling something at less than its
          value.<br />
          <br />
          4. Sell at a loss.<br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <big>ONLY PEOPLE THAT VALUE GOD MAKE SACRIFICES FOR HIM</big> <br />
        <p>
          In 2 Samuel 24:24 <br />we read this statement of King David: <br />

          “And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee
          at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God
          of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor
          and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.” <br /><br />

          People are only willing to give up something for another thing of a
          higher value. One will never border to give up anything for God if he
          does not care about his relationship with God. A lot of
          <br /><br />
          people in the Bible made expensive sacrifices for God just to show how
          much they value him and we are competing with such people for heaven.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>Some of them are:</big> <br />
        <p>
          Abraham who was willing to sacrifice his only son. (Gen 22:1-14)<br /><br />
          Jephthah was willing and did sacrifice his only child as a burnt
          offering to God. (Judges 11:35) David sacrificed his life and
          posterity to redeem the name and honour of God from Goliath’s insult.
          (1 Sam 17:45)<br /><br />
          Moses sacrificed his royalty and palace life to suffer afflictions and
          live as a hired shepherd all his business life just because of the
          cause of God. When he left the palace, I don’t think he ever had the
          opportunity to build his own house until death but he was arguably the
          greatest Israelite ever minus the Messiah. (Hebrews 11:24-27)<br /><br />
          Ruth sacrificed her bright future as a young lady to make a huge
          sacrifice to nurse an old mother in law till death. (Ruth 1:15-18)
          Etc.<br /><br />
          My worry is that we are competing with such people for heaven and some
          of us are still dragging their feet in making sacrifices for God.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>HEAVEN MUST COST US SOMETHING</big><br />
        <p>
          People don’t walk into heaven just like that. There must be a price
          each person must pay. Each person must have a story to tell about the
          pains they bore and losses they sustained just to make it to heaven.
          If people don’t want to give up their rights, comforts, gains, etc for
          the Kingdom of heaven, they will loose all.<br /><br />
          Matthew 16:24-27<br />
          24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me,
          let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  25 For
          whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose
          his life for my sake shall find it.  26 For what is a man profited, if
          he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a
          man give in exchange for his soul?  27 For the Son of man shall come
          in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward
          every man according to his works.<br /><br />
          Hymn 358 in Songs of the Church asks the question: “Must Jesus bear
          the cross alone and all the world go free?”. (SOC 358 for all)
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>A CALL TO TOTAL REPENTANCE AND CHANGE OF ATTITUDE</big><br />
        <p>
          Stepping into this new year, we must have a total repentance and
          change of attitude from our old ways, old feelings and a repentant
          heart. If you have people you blacklisted, remove them from that
          blacklist because of God. If you have people you have severed
          relationship with, restore that relationship because of God. If you
          have people you still have bitterness against, remove that bitterness
          from your heart because of God. <br /><br />
          Joel 2:12-13<br />
          12 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all
          your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:  13
          and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto
          the LORD your God:
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>CONCLUSION</big><br />
        <p>
          From the first day of exodus of children of Israel from Egyptian
          bondage in February, God did something very remarkable. He dropped the
          old global calendar and created a fresh calendar for Israel to start
          life afresh. He made the month of their Exodus the first month of the
          year for them just to give them a feeling of a new beginning.
          <br /><br />
          Exodus 12:1-2 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of
          Egypt, saying,  2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of
          months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
          <br /><br />
          In like manner, I would like us to give this church a new beginning as
          we start year 2023. Let us make it that expected glorious church
          without spot, wrinkles or any blemishes.
          <br /><br />
          Ephesians 5:27<br />
          that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having
          spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and
          without blemish.
          <br /><br />
          Just like Matthew 5:8 says, “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they
          shall see God.” Let us always desire to see God. Let us enter 2023
          with a pure heart. We must ignore whatever or whoever will try to put
          bitterness in our hearts. Nobody has the right to make us sad or
          bitter anymore so we won’t give room to anyone to steal our happiness
          in 2023 and beyond in Jesus name, Amen!
