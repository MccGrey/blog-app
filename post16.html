          Deuteronomy 4:4 <br />But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your
          God are alive every one of you this day
        </p>
        <p>
          A God-friendly heart is a heart that is very fond of God, loves God,
          fears God, anchors/holds on to God, trusts God, believes God, makes
          sacrifices for God, humbles himself before God, defends the name of
          God and hopes on God. This is the quality of hearts God wants to live
          in heaven for all eternity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>INTRODUCTION</big><br />

        <p>
          In 2 Chronicles 16:9,<br />
          we read, “For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
          earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose
          heart is perfect toward him. ” <br /><br />

          This message is about the disposition of our hearts towards God which
          ultimately reflects in how we live or behave in and outside the
          church. How we talk in and outside the church, how we reason in and
          outside the church, how we relate with others in and outside the
          church, etc.<br /><br />

          We are going to briefly look at the lives of some Bible characters
          that loved God and draw inspiration from them. <br /><br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>SOME BIBLE CHARACTERS WITH GOD-FRIENDLY HEARTS</big><br />
        <p>
          The list will be much so let’s take a few: <br /><br />
          ABEL: - He owed nobody anything but when he and his brother Cain were
          to make sacrifices to God, he conditioned his heart to think and
          believe that God deserved the best of all he had. (Gen. 4:4) Do you
          give to God freely or joyfully or only when you are pushed?
          <br /><br />

          ENOCH: - His name is defined as “Dedicated” and he lived in the days
          when there was no law or human government . People lived wildly as
          they liked but Enoch carved out a lifestyle for himself that was
          anchored on the fear of God so much that God did not even allow him to
          die. (Gen. 5:22-24) Do you like to enjoy your right at all times or do
          you sacrifice your freedom just for righteousness to rule?
          <br /><br />
          NOAH: - Like Enoch, Noah had every opportunity to enjoy his freedom to
          live as he liked because in his days, evil was so much that God cursed
          the land (Gen. 5:29), but he chose to be different and to direct his
          household towards the fear of God. (Gen. 6:9) What do you do in the
          midst of ungodly men? Do you join in their worldly jokes or promote
          Christ in their midst?
        </p>
        <p>
          ABRAHAM: - He came from an idol worshipping region of Chaldean.
          Remember that Laban was Abraham’s step brother and brother to
          Abraham’s wife – Sarah but he had idols in his house one of which
          Rachel stole when Jacob’s family were leaving. (Gen. 31:30-32). Coming
          from such background, Abraham maintained a righteous lifestyle that
          made God to call him and asked him to leave that region and afterwards
          called him “My friend”. (Gen. 12:1, Isaiah 41:8) What do you do when
          people push for chaos in and outside the church? Do you add fire
          instead of being the lone righteous voice? <br /><br />

          JACOB: - Barring his craftiness in stealing in stealing the blessings
          of Esau which he legitimately purchased from Esau with the porridge
          earlier, Jacob showed his faithfulness and trustworthiness through his
          service to Laban for twenty years. (Gen. 31:36-42). How trustworthy
          have you been in the things or works of God. Do you disappear when
          work or evangelism is organized? <br /><br />

          JOSEPH: - Joseph had already left his father’s land where moral values
          were upheld and promoted. In Egypt, nobody was teaching him or
          rebuking him on moral issues just like some children that left their
          families to join life in the campus but yet, because Joseph had
          conditioned his heart to be God-friendly, he accepted to suffer than
          to sleep with his master’s wife. (Gen. 39:7-9) How do you live out
          there outside the church environment? Do you play double standard or
          maintain purity even in secret places?
        </p>
        <p>
          PHINEHAS: - A young man son of Eleazar the priest saw a young Hebrew
          man brought a Moabite lady into the camp during the Exodus. All the
          elders including Moses saw him and only lamented but didn’t take any
          action. Because Phinehas had already conditioned his heart to defend
          the will of God went after the man and with his spear pinned the man
          and the woman to the ground. (Num. 25:6-8). What do you do when
          someone or some people are bringing the church or the name of God to
          disrepute? Do you watch from the the sidelines or take action?
          <br /><br />

          DAVID: - Even though he was not a trained soldier, but because his
          heart had been conditioned not to hear and accept insult on the name
          of God, he risked his life to redeem the honour of God even when the
          captain’s of Israeli soldiers and the king himself showed no concern.
          God earlier called him the man after my heart foreseeing the kind
          heart David had towards him. (1 Sam. 17:26, 1 Samuel 13:14) Have you
          risked getting enemies for yourself just because you are fighting for
          righteousness?
        </p>
        <p>
          SHEDRACK, MESHACH AND ABADNEGGO: - They had a reasonable excuse to
          worship an idol because it was a forceful order from the overall king
          of the Empire. Despite that failure to oblige was death, they had
          conditioned their hearts never to compromise their religious
          convictions; not even in a bid to obey the government. (Daniel
          3:16-18). Do you compromise your Christian values because your boss in
          the office compelled you to? <br /><br />

          STEPHEN: - In his preaching to the Jews, he still told them the truth
          not considering the hostility that would come from them. (Acts 6 & 7).
          Do you always tell people the truth when need be or do you prefer to
          keep quiet to avoid offending or having problems with anyone?
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>CONCLUSION </big><br />
        <p>
          We can make ourselves look beautiful before God. Not by beauty of our
          fabrics but by the beauty of lives, relationships, mentality,
          devotion, commitment, sacrifice and general godliness. <br /><br />

          Peter admonished the Christian women that their beauty should not be
          outward adorning but the hidden man of the heart. (1 Peter 3:3-4).
          This admonition goes to all Christians. We must nurse our hearts to
          God-friendly.
