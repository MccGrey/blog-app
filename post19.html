        <big>INTRODUCTION</big><br />
        <p>
          In the book of Revelations 18:2,4 we read: “…Babylon the great is
          fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the
          hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful
          bird.” …4  And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of
          her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
          receive not of her plagues.” This means that this symbolic Babylon was
          once pure and glorious but suddenly changed to something else. This is
          a vision about the glorious church of God that was corrupted by the
          merger with the pagan Roman Empire which removed the global oversight
          of the Church from Christ to the Roman Empire through its emperors and
          popes. Instead of the church being subject to Christ according to
          Ephesians 5:24, it became subject to the religious decrees of the
          Roman Emperors and Roman Pontiffs. By this shift, the Church
          ultimately seized from relying wholly on the laws of Christ through
          the Bible but began to rely on the Decrees of the Roman Emperors and
          Pontiffs. What it means is that the Church became the Church of Rome
          rather than the Church of God. <br /><br />

          It also resulted in the church having a set of doctrines that is a
          mixture of Bible and Roman traditions. At a stage, Popes could install
          and dispose kings. At a point, there were no more emperors; Pope
          became the overall political and religious ruler of the entire world
          and made bishops temporal (material or political) Lords over regions
          from which they got the title: “His Lordship”. This assumption of a
          mixture of political and spiritual duties by the church turned the
          Church of God into a government cum spiritual organization of the
          Roman Empire. By this, the fall of the symbolic Babylon was completed.
          <br /><br />

          Today, we are going to look at how Emperor Constantine midwifed this
          unholy union between the Church of God and the Roman Empire.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big
          >THE WAR OF MILVIAN BRIDGE IN 312AD AND OF THE CHRYSOPOLIS IN
          324AD</big
        ><br />
        <p>
          After the defeat of Maxentius, Constantine then decided to unify the
          entire empire under his authority. On his way to Rome to effect the
          overthrow of his opposition, he was said to have seen a sign of the
          cross in the sky with the Greek inscription “By this conquer.”  In
          323, Constantine defeated Valerius Licinius who had been a claimant to
          the throne and a persecutor of Christians and with whom he previously
          co-authored the Edict of Milan. Following this victory, he became the
          sole Emperor of the entire Roman Empire. <br /><br />

          According to Constantine’s biographer Eusebius, in the night of the
          incidence of the cross of light in the sky with the Greek inscription,
          “By this conquer”, Constantine had a dream in which Christ allegedly
          reinforced the message. The emperor marked the symbol of the cross on
          his soldiers’ shields. When he triumphed over Licinius at the battle
          of Chrysopolis in 324AD, he attributed the victory to the God of the
          Christians although there is no evidence of this recognition in the
          inscriptions and carvings of his Victory Arch in Rome. Modern scholars
          still debate the tale and whether Constantine’s conversion was sincere
          or a political maneuver. Regardless, in 313AD Constantine had met with
          Licinius, the Eastern Emperor, and together they issued the Edict of
          Milan. The edict granted “to the Christians and other religions full
          authority to observe that religion which each preferred.” This Edict
          was not only for Christians but for all religions within the Roman
          Empire.

        <br />
        <big>HOW CONSTANTINE TACTICALLY INFLUENCED CHRISTIANITY </big><br />
        <p>
          Following his claim of defeating Valerius Licinius through the help of
          the God of the Christians and previously issuance of the Edict of
          Milan, he bought the hearts of the global Christian community who saw
          in him a Saviour sent to deliver them from the fiery persecutions.
          <br /><br />

          There was no moral aspect of Constantine’s life that suggested that he
          was truly a Christian convert because he maintained devotion to the
          sun god. Throughout his reign, he paid allegiance to the sun god and
          honoured the sun god in many ways. This shows that he probably
          embraced Christianity just to ensure the social stability, unity and
          peace of his reign over the Empire than personal religious convictions
          or love for the Christian God. He never really accepted to be baptized
          until his death when he was sprinkled as baptism on his death bed.
          <br /><br />

          The historian says that “In order to preserve the ‘UNITY’ of the
          church, Constantine took a hand in all internal affairs.” Mattox, F.W.
          (1961, pg 127) ‘The Eternal Kingdom’. In page 132 of the same book, we
          have this extract: “This active interest in behalf of the church led
          Christians to exalt Constantine and rely on his decisions. He soon
          took the affairs of the church into his own hands and became
          dictatorial.” Now, a devout believer and worshipper of Sol-Invictus
          (Unconquered Sun) is the overall controller of the Church of God. How
          could once glorious Babylon not have become a den of demons? (Rev.
          18:1-4) <br /><br />

          God couldn’t have considered Constantine a Christian since he
          maintained devotion to the sun god and managed the Church unbaptized
          at the same time. It was a case of an idol worshipper high-jacking the
          management of the church. <br /><br />

          “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot
          be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.” (1
          Corinthians 10:21)

          >CONSTANTINE’S RESPECT AND HONOUR FOR THE DAY OF THE SUN AND NOT FOR
          CHRISTIANITY IS SHOWN IN THE WORDING OF HIS EDICT FOR WORK-FREE DAY ON
          SUN’S DAY </big
        ><br />
        <p>
          Constantine decreed (March 7, 321) dies Solis—day of the sun,
          “Sun-day”—as the Roman day of rest [CJ3.12.2]: <br /><br />

          “On the venerable day of the Sun let the magistrates and people
          residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the
          country however persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully
          continue their pursuits because it often happens that another day is
          not suitable for grain-sowing or vine planting; lest by neglecting the
          proper moment for such operations the bounty of heaven should be
          lost.” <br /><br />

          There is not a mention or reference to Christianity as the reason for
          the Edict but to venerate the day of Sun. The phrase the venerable day
          of the Sun shows his allegiance, respect and inner feelings. He
          proudly dedicated that day in HONOUR of the Sun and not to allow
          Christians to worship without distractions because he didn’t say so
          nor showed any sign for such unwarranted conclusion.

          >STRONG CLAIM THAT NATALIS INVICTI OF DEC. 25 WAS NOT CELEBRATED
          BEFORE 4TH CENTURY AD. A SUGGESTION IT WAS CONSTANTINE’S CREATION</big
        ><br />
        <p>
          Sol Invictus and Christianity <br />
          The Philocalian calendar of 354 CE gives a festival of "Natalis
          Invicti" on 25 December. There is limited evidence that this festival
          was celebrated before the mid 4th century CE. If it was not, then
          Constantine probably inspired it. <br /><br />

          Whether the 'Sol Invictus' festival "has a strong claim or the
          responsibility for the December 25 date" of Christmas as per the
          1908 Catholic Encyclopedia or not has been called into question by
          Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, who challenged
          this theory by arguing that a December 25 date was determined simply
          by calculating nine months beyond March 25, regarded as the day of
          Jesus’ conception (the Feast of the Annunciation). In the 5th century,
          Pope Leo I (the Great) spoke of how the celebration of Christ's birth
          coincided with the sun's position increasing in the sky in several
          sermons on the Feast of the Nativity. Here is an excerpt from his
          twenty-sixth sermon: “But this Nativity which is to be adored in
          heaven and on earth is suggested to us by no day more than this when,
          with the early light still shedding its rays on nature, there is borne
          in upon our senses the brightness of this wondrous mystery.”
          <br /><br />

          Comment: By this, he is trying to justify the connection of Christmas
          with the Sun which evidently shows that Christmas is a mere
          Christianization of Natalis Invicti. It is evident that Christianity
          has nothing to do with December 25 celebration but the feast being
          celebrated in disguise is Natalis Invicti. The above Popes’ arguments
          have not successfully separated Christmas from Natalis Invicti. There
          are too many Roman Catholic lies. <br /><br />

          Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall
          depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines
          of devils; 2  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience
          seared with a hot iron; 3  Forbidding to marry, and commanding to
          abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with
          thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. (1 Tim 4:1-3 1)
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>CONSTANTINE’S INFLUENCE ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</big
        ><br />
        <p>
          God designed the Church of God to be autonomous such that each
          congregation should have multiple resident bishops and multiple
          resident Deacons and an Evangelist or Evangelists. There is no cluster
          system or grouped or centralized administrative structure or system.
          <br /><br />

          Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in
          Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.
          (Philippians 1:1) <br /><br />

           And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
          prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they
          believed. (Acts 14:23) <br /><br />

          In order to have control over the church, Constantine ensured that
          Christian bishops were grouped and structured according to the
          Empire’s administrative system such that some bishops will be under
          other bishops, thereby changing the law of God. The Council of Nicaea
          in 325AD exalted three bishops (Antioch, Alexandria and Rome) above
          the rest who they called Metropolitans and subjected other bishops in
          their various regions under them thereby ensuring organizational
          departure of the Church from Scriptural design. The number of the
          Metropolitans was later increased to four following the building of
          the city of Constantinople and the elevation of its bishop to
          Metropolitan. This restructuring of the administrative framework of
          the church later crystalized in overall one man rule called Pope,
          hence fulfilling the prophecy of Paul about the Man of Sin. (2
          Thessalonians 2:3-4)

        <br />
        <big>CONSTANTINE’S INFLUENCE ON THE CREATION OF FIRST CHURCH CREED</big
        ><br />
        <p>
          Constantine calling himself Bishop of Bishops chaired over the Council
          of Nicaea which he convened in 325AD that created the first creed of
          the church which himself drafted and edited after the resolutions of
          about 318 bishops in attendance. The Bible is complete enough to be
          the only book of religious authority. No further creed is needed.
          <br /><br />

          16  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
          for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
          righteousness: 17  That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
          furnished unto all good works. (2 Timothy 3:16-17 ) <br /><br />

          The creed effectively separated Jesus and the Holy Spirit as separate
          independent deities from the Father and formed the foundation for the
          doctrine of three united Gods or what we call Trinity which did not
          exist before the Council of Nicaea. Christian teaching about God had
          always pointed out to one Deity called God or The Father whose word
          was made flesh and was born as a man and called Jesus and whose Spirit
          was called The Holy Spirit; who in his fullness (with his Word and
          Spirit) is called the Godhead as a single Deity . <br /><br />

          Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think
          that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art
          and man's device. (Acts 17:29 ) <br /><br />

          For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
          clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
          eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: (Rom. 1:20
          ) <br />
          <br />

          One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in
          you all. (Ephesians 4:6 )
          <br /><br />
          Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time,
          and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside
          me? yea, there is no God; I know not any. (Isaiah 44:8)
        </p>
        <br />
        <big
          >CONSTANTINE’S ACCEPTANCE OF ARIANISM – THE IDEA THAT CHRIST IS NOT
          DIVINE</big
        ><br />
        <p>
          Constantine who drafted the Nicene Creed was said to have died
          believing on the doctrine of Arius which says that Jesus was not
          eternal like the Father and not of the same essence (nature) with the
          God. Constantine himself later received communion from an Arian priest
          and, so, he truly did not believe in the eternal Jesus but in the
          created Jesus meanwhile, Bible shows that Jesus, as Word had always
          existed with God and share the same eternal beginning with Him for God
          never at any time, existed without his Word. <br /><br />

          1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
          Word was God. 2  The same was in the beginning with God. 3  All things
          were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was
          made. …14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
          beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)
          full of grace and truth. (John 1:1-3,4)
          <br /><br />
          In fact, in his book ‘The Eternal Kingdom’ Dr. Mattox said,
          <br /><br />
          “Although only two bishops stood with Arius in this condemnation, many
          of the bishops had signed the creed without agreeing to it. These
          bishops began to work for a reversal of the decision. … In 359 the
          Council of Ariminum accepted an Arian creed, and even the bishop of
          Rome Liberius (352-366) , after defending Athanasius , at last gave
          way to the Arian views and the entire church seemed to be in the hands
          of the Arians” Mattox, F.D., (1961, pg. 142)
          <br /><br />
          This is a sign of departure from faith in the real Jesus to a wrong
          Jesus that has a beginning who was later patterned by Catholic Church
          after the Roman sun-god with a shining or glowing head. Remember that
          Dr. Mattox book was based on Eusebius History of the Christian Church
          written in the 4th Century AD.

          It also warns that we should not add or subtract from the written word
          of God. (Revelations 22:18-19)
          <br /><br />
          It warns that we should contend for the faith which was once delivered
          unto the saints. (Jude 3)
          <br /><br />
          It declared that if anyone should preach any other gospel, let him be
          accursed. (Galatians 1:6-10)
          <br /><br />
          Despite all these commandments and warnings from the Bible, creating
          new religious laws and doctrines through church synods was started by
          Constantine in 325AD. From that point, countless unscriptural
          doctrines and practices have been created through church synods.
          <br /><br />
          As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
          Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other
          doctrine. (1 Timothy 1:3)
          <br /><br />
          But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have
          obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
          (Romans 6:17)

        <big>CONCLUSION</big> <br />
        <p>
          We have seen that the contributions of Emperor Constantine to
          Christianity were more destructive than they were good. His
          restructuring of the organizational administrative system of the
          church in the Council of Nicaea was the starting point of Church
          Apostasy. He introduced the worship of the Sun-god into Christianity
          which patterned Jesus after the Sun-god with a glowing head.
          <br /><br />
          It was the influence of Constantine that led to the change of the
          designation of the church from Church of God to Roman Catholic Church
          thus showing the shift of allegiance from God to the pagan Roman
          Empire. This was how the merger of the Church with the Roman Empire
          happened and this corruption of the church with pagan Roman
          abominations is exactly what the vision of the fallen Babylon
          signifies.
          <br /><br />
          1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven,
          having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. 2  And
          he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is
          fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the
          hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful
          bird. 3  For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
          fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication
          with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the
          abundance of her delicacies. 4  And I heard another voice from heaven,
          saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her
          sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. (Revelations 18:1-4)
