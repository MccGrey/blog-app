        <p>Topic Text: Psalm 133:1</p>
        <p>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity!</p>
        <p>Memory Verse: Matthew 12:30</p>
        <p>He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</p>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Just like our general theme says: &quot;TRUE FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD AND WITH THE BRETHREN&quot; we have seen
        what it means to have true fellowship with God, in this month, we shall see what it means to have fellowship with
        the brethren. We have outlined three topics under this November monthly theme as follow::</p>
        <p>1. The pleasantness of living in harmony and love.</p>
        <p>2. How God hates sowing of discord among the brethren.</p>
        <p>3. Peacemaking, a proof of sonship to God.</p>
        <p>Today, we shall look at the first topic which is &quot;The pleasantness of living in harmony and love.&quot;</p>
        <h2>HARMONY AND LOVE OF THE BRETHREN IS ALWAYS THE WISH OF
            GOD OUR FATHER</h2>
        <p>Every parent wishes his or her family to live together in harmony and love. God is also a parent and indeed the
        parent of all parents. That is why we call him our FATHER. Paul also said that humankind are the offspring of God
            
        (Acts 17:29); therefore he is our parent. If therefore he is our parent, then we must obey and honour him in all things.</p>
        <p>Malachi 1:6
        A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? ...</p>
        <p>God has expressed his delight to see brethren live together in perfect unity as shown in Psalm 133:1-3 where his
        Spirit said:</p>
        <p>1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! 2 It is like the
        precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron&#39;s beard: That went
        down to the skirts of his garments; 3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended
        upon the mountains of Zion: For there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for
        evermore.</p>
        <p>Jesus our Lord also prayed in Gatsemane that we should be made perfect in onesness not only in doctrine but also
        in the heart.</p>
        <p>John 17:11-13 
        11And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep
        through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.12While I was
         with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them
        is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. 13And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</p>
        <h2>ADMONITIONS FROM THE EARLY SAINTS</h2>
        <br>
        <big>Paul to the Roman Christians</big>
        <p>Romans 15:5-6 
        5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to
        Christ Jesus: 6 that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus
        Christ.</p>
        <br>
        <big>Paul to Corinthian Christians</big>
        <p>2 Corinthians 13:11 
        Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of
        love and peace shall be with you.</p>
        <br>
        <big>Paul to Philippian Christians</big>
        <p>Philippians 2:1-3 1 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 2 fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. 3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</p>
        <br>
        <big>Peter to Jewish Christians</big>
        <p>1 Peter 3:8-9   - 8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: 9 not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</p>
        <h2>TO LIVE CONTRARY TO OUR FATHER&#39;S WISH IS TO BE REBELLIOUS AND THAT IS DISASTROUS</h2>
        <p>If God loves it when the brethren are united in love and Jesus prayed with sweat like a drop of blood that we should live in love and perfect unity, do you think that the members that are responsible for our disunity will go free? Never! And I repeat, NEVER! That is why we must all repent and pursue peace even when it is to our discomfort.</p>
        <p>Isaiah 30:1 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:</p>
        <p>Matthew 18:6-8 
        6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a
        millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 7 Woe unto the
        world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the
        offence cometh! 8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it
            
        is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire</p>
        <h2>HOW CAN WE HELP ONE ANOTHER TO MAINTAIN THIS REQUIRED LOVE AND HARMONY?</h2>
        <p>As true children of God, we must not be tired of doing good and pursuing peace. Every member may not have thesame level of grace and maturity to maintain peace and love in the brotherhood and such members should not be left to die in their sins. We must help them and sincerely too. It still shocks me that Jesus knew all along that Judas was a Devil and yet still managed him and even allowed him to be treasurer of the apostles.</p> 
        <p>John 6:66-71 
        66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. 67Then said Jesus unto
        the twelve, Will ye also go away? 68Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou
        hast the words of eternal life. 69And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. 70Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 71He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
        Jesus knew that Judas was also a thief and still allowed him to be the treasurer, that is tolerance in action.
        Tolerance is always required for harmony to exist between brethren.</p>
        <p>John 12:3-6 
        3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped
        his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 4Then saith one of his
        disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon&#39;s son, which should betray him, 5Why was not this ointment sold for three
        hundred pence, and given to the poor? 6This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a
        thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>
        <h2>THESES ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO TO HELP ONE ANOTHER</h2>
        <p>1. Ignore his faults and still be close to him. (1 Peter 4:8)</p>
        <p>2. Where reconciliation is required, forget about his ego and pride and go to him for reconciliation even if he is the actual offender. (Matthew 5:23-34)</p>
        <p>3. Pursue peace with all men not because of what you will gain from it but because you want to be right with
        God. (Hebrews 12:14)</p>
        <p>4. Help the bad brother to become good because it still adds to the souls you have won for Christ. (James
        5:19-20)</p>
        <p>5. Be always ready to forgive because the forgiver is always greater than the forgiven in the sight of God.
        (Read Matthew 18:23-35)</p>
        <p>6. Two people are only together either because both are wise or because one volunteers to take the place of a fool from the actual fool. (1 Corinthians 6:7)</p>
        <h2>THE CHURCH THRIVES IN ALL ASPECTS OF GROWTH WHEN THERE IS LOVE AND HARMONY
        AMONG THE BRETHREN</h2>
        <p>Prophet Amos asked this question:</p>
        <p>Amos 3:3  
         Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</p>
         <p>The answer to the above question is No!. So many things will stall when disaffection exists among the brethren for
        instance, two enemies will not call each other for personal evangelism. A member may choose not to help another
        member in need because of fear of his help being turned down and a member may not have the courage to
        approach enemy brother for help. Prayers to God will not be answered because such prayers are coming from dirty
        hearts. Etc. Generally, the church will be worse off when there is no love and harmony among the brethren. The
        wise man also has this to tell us:</p>
        <p>Eccl 4:9-12 
        9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 10For if they fall, the one will
        lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
        11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? 12 And if one prevail
        against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>Won&#39;t you choose to become an agent of love and harmony in this Church of Christ today? God needs
        people like you to create love and harmony in the church. Do it for him and a great reward will be
        waiting for you from him.</p>
        <big>&quot;Love one another, thus says the Saviour. Children obey the Father&#39;s blest command&quot; (2x)</big>
