          <h2>THE DOCTRINE OF TRINITY CONT...</h2>
          <big>BIBLE TEACHING ON GOD, JESUS AND HOLY SPIRIT</big>
          <p>
            - The Bible teaches there is only ONE INDIVIDUAL GOD also called THE FATHER.

          </p>
          <p>One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. (Ephesians 4:6)
        </p>
        <p>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) 6  But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. (1 Corinthians 8:5-6)
        </p>
        <p>
            Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any. (Isaiah 44:8)
            </p>
            <p>- The above Scriptures explicitly declare that there is no other Gods beside God the Father either in heaven or on earth. God the Father has no colleagues as fellow deities. What he has are components of himself which are His WORD and His SPIRIT by which he accomplishes his wills.
            </p><br>
            <big>THE ERROR OF NICENE CREED ON JESUS’ SONSHIP</big>
            <p>- Another error of the Nicene Creed was that it says that Christ was begotten before he came down to earth to save man. The term “begotten” means to be given birth to so by implication, they are also agreeing that Christ is not eternal but was given birth to by God before his appearance on earth. Below is an extract from the original Nicene Creed as reported by Eusebius:
            </p>

            <p>“…begotten and not made, being of one substance with the Father; by whom are all things both in heaven and on earth were made. Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and took our nature, and became man;….”
            </p>
            <p>This means that Jesus was already begotten before he became “Man” but this is the main point of the error because if you say that Innocent was begotten before he became a human being, you then have to explain what you mean by the term “begotten”. It is evident that the conception and birth of Jesus as a man was the point the Bible refers him as the “ONLY BEGOTTEN OF THE FATHER”. That is to say, the only man whose conception was not by man’s sexual intercourse but by direct operation of The Father. Jesus’ begotten nature therefore refers to his human nature and not his eternal nature. It is in his human existence that he is called the only Son or human begotten by God. What he was from eternity was the “THE WORD” through which God created all things. (John 1:1-3, Ephesians 3:9) One’s word is not begotten by him but an aspect or a part of himself. It was until the Word was made flesh that he became begotten as a Son.
            </p>
            <p>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. (Luke 1:35, also see Psalms 2:7)
            </p>
            <p>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. (John 1:14)
            </p><br>
            <big>BIBLE TEACHING ON JESUS THE SON OF GOD</big>
            <p>- The Bible teaches that Jesus was the WORD through which God or the Father created all things that exist, and that this Spirit-Word was made to assume a human flesh through conception by Mary so he could be sacrificed for man’s salvation. 
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2  The same was in the beginning with God. 3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. …14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. (John 1:1 -3,14) 
            </p>
            <p>This means that Jesus is not another God from the Father but an extension or an aspect of the Father and so Jesus and the Father are one and not fellows.
            </p>
        <p>Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 9  Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? 10  Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 11  Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake. (John 14:8-11)
        </p>
        <p>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. (Isaiah 9:6)  
        </p>
        <p>The doctrine of Trinity claims that the Father is not the Son and that the Son is not the Father but Jesus said, “I and my Father are one.” [not “are united”]  (John 10:30) because the WORD of the FATHER is not different from THE FATHER but part of HIM.
        </p>
        <br>
        <big>BIBLE TEACHING ON THE HOLY SPIRIT</big>
        <p>- The Holy Spirit is the same one called “the Spirit of God” and the same one God calls “My Spirit”
        </p>
    <p>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. (Genesis 1:2)
    </p>
    <p>And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 
        (Genesis 6:3)
        </p>
        <p>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: (Joel 2:28)
        </p>
        <p>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 7  But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. (1 Corinthians 12:6-7)
        </p>
        <p>The Father does not leave his throne in heaven to come down to earth to speak to them or perform miracles through men; instead, he deposits his Spirit in men to use them to accomplish his will on earth. Is the spirit of Innocent different from Innocent, or is it another human being? Why then does the Doctrine of Trinity say that The Father is not The Spirit and that The Spirit is not The Father and yet, the Spirit is His Spirit? That is falsehood.
        </p>
        <br>
        <big>THE IDEA OF GODHEAD DOES NOT REFER TO THEM BUT TO HIM</big>
        <p>- The idea of Godhead does not denote multiplicity but fullness. The tripartite nature of God the Father is what the term ‘GODHEAD’ refers to. God made man to be a reflection (image and likeness) of himself as a tripartite being with BODY, SOUL and SPIRIT. That’s why 1 Corinthians 2:11  says, “For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.” If the spirit of man is not an independent being from the man, how is the Spirit of God an independent being from God? The Spirit of God is not a colleague of God but a part or an aspect of Him.
        </p>
        <p>- When the WORD of God is out on an assignment (Jesus on earth) and the Spirit of God is out on an assignment (Holy Spirit in men), The Father is not in his fullness but when the Word of God and the Spirit of God are both in God, then The Father is in the fullness of his eternal power and Godhead.
        </p>
        <p>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: (Romans 1:20)
        </p>
        <p>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. (Acts 17:29)
        </p>
        <p>- When Jesus was on earth, The Father was in him and gave him the Spirit without measure (John 3:34) and therefore it was said:
        </p>
        <p>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. 10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:  (Colossians 2:9-10)
        </p>
        <p>- We are complete in him and that is why we are baptized in the name of The Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The second stanza of “O Listen to our Wondrous story” is an error we inherited from the apostate and Romanized church that teaches that Jesus is one of the three GODs instead of an extension of the one and only GOD.

          </div>
          <br>
          <big>CHRONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OF THE ERROR</big>
        <p>- Irenaeus of Lyon, Gaul (130 – 200AD) who in discussing the consequence of the fall of Adam taught that ‘this brought man under the control of Satan and cost mankind the “divine likeness”’.  He therefore originated the idea.
        </p>
        <p>- Origen of Alexandria (185-254AD) taught that souls of men were created with lesser degree of sins than that of the Demons and evil spirits even before Adam sinned. In other words, the soul of Adam was already guilty of sin before Adam ate the forbidden fruit. 
        </p>
        <p>- Tertullian of Carthage [Tunisia] (160-220) firmly formulated this doctrine. “He taught that the soul shares in Adam’s guilt and every man therefore is under condemnation and punishable for his inherited guilt quite apart from any actual sin he may commit.” 
        </p>
        <p>- Cyprian of Carthage [Tunisia] (248-258AD) enlarged Tertullian’s theory by declaring “that even though infant had committed no actual sin, it needed forgiveness for the sin inherited from Adam and this was received in baptism. He was the first to approve infant baptism.” 
        </p>
        <p>- The question is, if children were sinners because of Adam and need forgiveness through baptism, why were children of Apostolic era not baptized? There is no single instance that they were baptized and the requirements before baptized excludes them because one must HEAR the word of God, BELIEVE, REPENT and CONFESS Christ as God’s son before being IMMERSED. These are not requirements for infants.
        </p>
        <br>
        <big>DEPARTURE IN THE MODE OF BAPTISM</big>
        <p>Despite all these doctrinal shifts on the doctrine of sin, infant baptisms were occasionally practiced before 325AD, but it was not until  after Augustine who was regarded as the strongest advocate for infant baptism after 450AD that it became a common practice. Sprinkling baptism was also accepted this period only on an emergency basis. It developed through baptism of the sick. Baptism through out this period was recognized as necessary for the remission of sins and for salvation. Unbaptized would become seriously ill and immersion would seem unwise.  The priest would pour small amount of water on the subject’s head and call it baptism. The law of God ought not to be amended for the sick. (Deuteronomy 12:32, Revelations 22:18-19)
        </p>
        <p>The first known case of sprinkling baptism was Novatian in 251AD. What was introduced as an exception later became the rule. Sprinkling was not commonly practiced in the third and fourth centuries. <br>
            Christians were expected to be immersed for the remission of their sins. 

        </p>
        <p>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 4  Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 5  For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: 6  Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. (Romans 6:3-6, also see Acts 8:36-39, 2:38, John 3:23)

          </div><br>
          <big>PROPHECY ABOUT ASCETICISM</big>
          <p>Some quickly point to Apostle Paul as an ascetic person just because he wasn’t married. Paul was not ascetic. He mingled fully with the society in eating, drinking, trade, preaching, etc. Through Paul, the Holy Spirit revealed departure from the faith into ascetic life of forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from foods.  Clement of Alexandria (150-215) even argued that Paul later married and described his wife as “a true yokefellow” (Philippians 4:3). Below is a prophecy concerning asceticism.

        <p>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 2  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 3  Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. (1 Timothy 4:1-3)
        </p>
        <p>The early signs of this prophecy began in the days of Clement of Alexandria. ‘To combat this, he wrote a weighty treatise “On Marriage” in which he defends marriage as proper. He not only used Scriptures as proof, but also referred to Peter’s being married and having children and to the fact that his wife was with him until the time of his martyrdom.’  During the first three centuries, there was no general rule against the right of marriage for ministers. The pressure towards celibacy came from the common people who believed that demons could more easily control a married man. Many of such people began to form themselves into monastic communities.  
        </p>

          </div><br>
          <h2>EASTER CELEBRATION</h2>
        <p>Some early Christians tried to work out a yearly calendar and place in it all of the important events in the life of Christ. this would give Christians special festivals and celebrations as were found among the Pagans and the Jews. The Jews had come in contact with the worship of Ishtar which was also known as the Queen of Heaven. Where the converts were largely Jews, it was natural to transfer as far as possible Jewish customs into Christianity. The attempts for Christian religious feasts actually started in the days of the Apostles and Paul effectively fought against it.
        </p>
        <p>But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? 10  Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. 11  I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain. (Galatians 4:9-11).
        </p>
        <p>The leaders of the churches were more desirous to make the church more attractive to the Jews and Pagans as these were accustomed to pompous ceremonies as part of their system, it was believed that they would hold the simplicity of Christian worship in contempt. To alleviate this prejudice, rites were made more elaborate and ceremonies expanded. Easter became one of the most elaborate of these celebrations. Controversy regarding the proper time of its celebration was resolved to be on Sundays by the Council of Nicaea in 325AD which was chaired by Emperor Constantine. The question to ask is, why the name Easter for the feast? Since Hebrew word for Passover is Pesah, Greek is Pascha and Latin is Pascal. Where is the name Easter coming from?

          </div><br>
        <p>Along with other changes in the fourth century as the service was becoming formal, special singers were appointed as a distinct class of officers in the church. This encouraged singing by a choir and by the fifth century, some mechanical music began to be introduced. In 670AD, Pope Vitalian introduced the first organ in the church history at the cathedral in Rome, but organs were not widely played in churches until the eight century. In fact, its introduction was met with great suspicion and even anger. 
        </p>
        <p>The organ gradually made its way into general usage in the Catholic church by thirteenth century but some of the Reformers, particularly John Calvin (1509 – 1564), considered it an instrument of the world and the devil. John Knox in Scotland set about removing the offending instruments. By 1727, only one organ could be found in all of the churches in Scotland. 
        </p>
        <p>Christians had been instructed to sing with the fruit of their lips and make melody in their hearts. 
        </p>
        <p>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. (Hebrews 13:15)
        </p>
        <p>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; (Ephesians 5:19)
        </p>
        <h2>PURGATORY</h2>
        <p>Gregory I who was also called Gregory the Great who became Pope in 590AD as the Bishop of Rome invented the doctrine of Purgatory which gives a sinner a second chance to escape hell fire after death. This doctrine destroys everything the preaching of the gospel stands for because it teaches that one could die as sinner and be temporarily punished for his sins in Purgatory after which he is transferred to Paradise. The gravity of the punishment is dependent upon the gravity of sins committed in life. The bible teaches that a person only has one opportunity to be saved while alive and as soon as death occurs, judgment is given for either condemnation or salvation. 
        </p>
        <p>(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) (2 Corinthians 6:2)
        </p>
        <p>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27)
        </p>
        <p>For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? (Psalms 6:5)
        </p>
        <p>And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? 3  I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:2-3)

          </div><br>
          <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
          <p>Doctrinal deviations of the apostate Roman Church which also include idol and image worship are too numerous to list or discuss but these are to prove that the prophecies about departures from the faith was largely fulfilled in the emergence of the Roman Catholic Church. They are the major departures from the original New Testament Christianity and they gave birth to other departures from the New Testament Christianity as we have them today. The Bible says,
        </p>
        <p>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. 10  If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: 11  For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. (2 John 1:9-11)
