        <h2>MEANING OF RESTORATION</h2>
        <p>MEANING OF RESTORATION</p>
        <p>
            1. MEANING OF RESTORATION <br> <br>
            2. The state of being restored to its former good condition. <br> <br>
            3. A model that represents the landscape of a former geological age or that represents an extinct animal, etc.
            <p>With the above dictionary definitions, we can easily understand the vision of the champions of the Restoration Movement in contrast with those of the Reformation Movement. As the Reformers largely decided to remain in the apostate church and change it from within, the Restorers were more direct and purposeful.  
            </p>
            <p>Understanding these two key periods in Christian history will open the horizon for purposeful bible studies which will help us to understand that God only wants perfect Christian unity in doctrines and practices rather than denominations with varying and contradicting doctrines and practices which are only loosely connected through socio-political unions and associations such as Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Scripture Union, etc. God wants Unity in Christianity and not Union.
            </p>
<h2>THE TWO WITNESSES, A SIMILITUDE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT, APOSTASY AND RESTORATION OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the book of Revelations chapter 11 verses 3 to 11, God gave an image that looks perfectly similar to the journey of the Church of Christ from its establishment, apostasy, restoration and final salvation.</p>

<p>In the imagery, God sent his two witnesses which some believe refers to the earthly Ministry of Jesus and the Ministry of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles and New Testament prophets who had power to stop Satan from operating while the revelation of the will of God was still ongoing. Both Jesus and his Apostles were killed when they finished their ministry but the product of their work which is the written Word of God was not killed but the same Word was lifeless during the period of Apostasy and global reign of Roman Pontiffs.

     <h2>Revelations 11:3-13</h2>
     <p>3  And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
    </p>
    <p>4  These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.
    </p>
<p>5  And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
</p>

<p>6  These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
</p>
<p>6  These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
</p>
<p>7  And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
</p>
<p>8  And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
</p>
<p>10  And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

</p>
<p>11  And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.

</p>
<p>12  And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
</p>
<p>13  And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
</p>
<h2>Analyzing Revelations 11:3-13 to see its similarity with the journey of the Church from establishment through restoration</h2>
<p>3  And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. 4  These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.
</p>
<p>1,260 days = 7 months x 7 = 42 months which signifies full completion of their ministries. They wore sackcloth because both Jesus and the Apostles worked under intense hostility by the authorities. Jesus described himself and the Holy Spirit as the two witnesses that came down from God to the earth. (John 16:28-31, John 15:26)
</p>
<p>5  And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. 6  These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
</p>
<p>Both Jesus and the Holy Spirit in his Apostles had power to suppress or subdue the influence or powers of Satan over their ministries. (Luke 10:17-19, Acts 13:6-12) 
</p>
<p>7  And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. </p>
<p>8  And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. 9  And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.
</p>
<p>After the completion of the ministry of Jesus and of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles, they were killed by the beast that symbolizes the Roman rulers (Pilate and Caesars). The Bible they gave us was however seen everywhere because it was not removed from existence just as their bodies were not buried but littered the streets.
</p>
<p>10  And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.
</p>
<p>During the time of apostasy, it was a time for all religious recklessness and freedom for all manner of religious falsehood without rebuke.
</p>
<p>11  And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.
</p>
<p>Three days and half  is 7 ÷ 2 so refers to a period of time after which life from God entered the dead church and it was restored to life and stands until the end of time.
</p>
<p>12  And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
</p>
<p>13  And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
</p>
<p>This refers to the ascension to heaven of the saved from the restored church and the final destruction and end of the earth and everything in it.
</p>
<p>Note: I am not saying with full assurance that the vision of the two witnesses refers to what I analyzed above but I am only saying that it is a great possibility.
</p>
<h2>WHAT IS RESTORATION MOVEMENT?</h2>
<p>This refers to the efforts made by different individuals from different denominational churches to unite all Christians into a common faith as given in the Bible from which the apostate church departed. 
</p>
<p>“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” (1 Timothy 4:1)
</p>
<p>“Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.” (Jude 1:3)
</p>
<p>It was the above instruction of contending for the original  Faith that the Restorers obeyed. To contend for that Faith, one needs to also heed the call in Revelations 18:4 which says,
</p>
<p>“And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins.” 
</p>
<p>Restoration Movement is therefore the push by some people for a return to the Bible to practice the New Testament pattern of Christianity. We shall be looking at such individuals from our next lesson.

  <p>- James O’Kelly opposed Asbury on the episcopal system of church government at the “Christmas Conference” in 1784 when the named Methodist Episcopal Church was selected for the Wesleyan Societies. </p>
  <p>- His opposition to the episcopal system continued until 1792 General Conference after when he failed to prevent what he believed to be unscriptural organization of the church, he withdrew from the Conference on 24th December 1793. 
</p>
  <p>- A number of preachers followed O’Kelly in his stand and called themselves “Republican Methodists”. 
</p>
<p>
    - In 1794, this group met again in Virginia during which Rice Haggard stood up with a Bible in his hand and pleaded that the Bible itself be accepted as their only creed.

</p>
<p>
    - He further moved a motion that they be just known as Christians. 

</p>
<p>
    - His motion was accepted and the group then drew up the “Five cardinal Principles of the Christian Church”.

</p>
<p><big>These Five cardinal Principles Include:
</big></p>
<p>1. Christ is the only Head of the Church.
</p>
<p>2. The name “Christians” is the only acceptable name, hence the group name “Christian Church.”
</p>
<p>3. The Bible is the only rule of faith.
</p>
<p>4. Christian character is the only test of church fellowship.
</p>
<p>5. The right of private judgment is the privilege of all.
</p>
<p>The first church with above conviction and practice was first established at Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1794. The difference between the “Christian Church” and the Methodists, was in organization and not doctrine.  Yet, they went to the Bible to learn the Scriptural form of organization. Such an attitude is fundamental to a complete “restoration” in any age.

  <h2>BARTON W. STONE</h2>
  <p>In 1801, over 30 thousand people poured into Cane Ridge, Kentucky for great revival and stone was preaching that area at the time. Methodist and Baptist preachers were invited to help. A number of preachers were in different parts of the camp ground preaching at the same time. Emotional excitement ran through the crowd producing physical emotional reactions of different kinds. Some fell to the ground as dead though dead and others experienced the “jerks”, some danced, laughed, ran or sang. This was supposedly a manifestation of the presence of Holy Spirit. 
</p>
<p>The preachers from different churches worked together in such a way that Stone was impressed with value and need for unity. Although desirable, the goal was never reached. When Stone stressed the fact that sinners had power to turn to Christ, a number of Calvinistic preachers opposed him. Among those who stood by him were Richard McNemar, John Thompson, John Dunlavy, Robert Marshal and David Purviance – all of whom joined Stone in forming a new Presbytery. 
</p>

<big>THE STEPS TAKEN TO RETURN TO NEW TESTAMENT CHRISTIANITY
</big>
<p>One of them – McNemar was charged with heresy in the synod in Lexington. Knowing they would all be suspended, these six preachers sent a statement of withdrawal to the synod. They then organized the “Springfield Presbytery”. After renouncing all human authority and taking the Bible as their only rule faith and practice, they started out to establish congregations after the New Testament order. 
</p>
<p>In less than a year, they saw that their own organization was unscriptural, and by common consent they dissolved it and determined to be Christians only. The document prepared to dissolve The Springfield Presbytery is unique and is worthy of study by anyone interested in the restoration of the New Testament Christianity. The document produced by them was entitled 
</p>
<p>“THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF THE SPRINGFIELD PRESBYTERY” and was signed by the six Preachers themselves.
</p>
<big>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE DOCUMENT
</big>
<p>
    - We will that our church should die and be dissolved and sink into the Body of Christ at large, for there is one Body, and one Spirit even as we are called in one hope of our calling.

</p>
<p>
    - We will that our name of distinction, with its Reverend title be forgotten, that there be but one Lord over God’s heritage and his name One. 

</p>

<p>- We will that our name of distinction, with its Reverend title be forgotten, that there be but one Lord over God’s heritage and his name One. 
</p>
<p>- We will that candidates for the ministry henceforth study the Holy Scriptures with fervent prayer, and obtain license from God to preach the simple Gospel, with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, without any mixture of philosophy, vain deceit, traditions of men, or the rudiments of the world. And let none henceforth take this honour to himself…
</p>
<p>- We will that the church of Christ resume her native right of internal government….
</p>
<p>- We will that each particular church (congregation), as a body actuated by the same Spirit, choose her own Preacher, and support him by freewill offering, without a written call or subscription - admit members -  remove offences, and never henceforth delegate her right of government to any man or a set of men whatever. 
</p>
<p>- We will that our weak brethren , who may have been wishing to make the Presbytery of Springfield their king, and wot not what is now become of it, betake themselves to the Rock of Ages and follow Jesus for the future. Etc.

  <h2>THOMAS CAMPBELL</h2>
  <p>He moved to America in May 13, 1807. He found that the Presbyterian Associate Synod of North America was in session in Philadelphia. Presenting his credential he was immediately assigned to the Presbytery of Chartiers in Southwest Pennsylvania.  
</p>
<p>The Seceder Presbyterian Association to which Thomas belonged was few so in the US, he discovered many other Presbyterians and Independents who were without leadership. Some of these people he had known from Ireland so, he included them all in his ministrations as brethren. This was contrary to Seceder practice and evoked criticism. 
</p>
<p>On a missionary tour with a young Seceder preacher named Wilson, he invited all the pious in the audience to participate in the communion service. Many who were not Seceders took advantage of the opportunity as no preacher was conducting regular service in the community. Wilson thought that this act could not be overlooked so he brought charges against Campbell in the next meeting of the Presbytery.
</p>
<p>In the course of investigation, Campbell however pleaded for a more Christian attitude toward liberty and fellowship but the Presbytery found him deserving of a rebuke.  Desiring peace among his brethren he submitted to the rebuke. Spies were sent however to his meetings by some who were dissatisfied with his “trial” in an attempt to grounds for fresh accusations. 
</p>
<p>Campbell soon saw that he could not be true to God and his conscience under such human limitations and after earnest prayer renounced the authority of both Presbytery and Synod. He determined to use his strength to unite all denominations on the basis of Scripture only. At this time, Thomas Campbell was the outstanding preacher in this area and he was highly respected by his denominational neighbours and the announcement he was leaving denominationalism made a deep impression in the community. A meeting was set for all who were interested in finding a Scriptural basis for unity.
</p>
<p>A large company of sincere persons assembled with a common desire to eliminate sects and parties and to seek closer fellowship. Campbell addressed the audience by reviewing the events that led to the meeting and argued strongly against sectarian divisions and pleaded for Christian unity. 
</p>
<p>He then suggested that the basis for unity was the Scripture itself and pleaded with the audience to accept this principle: “Where the Scriptures speak, we speak;  where the Scriptures are silent, we are silent.” No one in the audience could find any objection to this fair and clear basis for unity, yet they immediately saw the effect it would have on their doctrine and practice. After Campbell made this suggestion, Andrew Munro arose and said:
</p>
<p>“Mr Campbell, if we adopt that as a basis, then there is an end of infant baptism.”  This remark, and the conviction it seemed to carry with it produced a profound sensation. “Of course” said Mr. Campbell in reply, “if infant baptism be not found in Scripture, we can have nothing to do with it.” 
</p>
<p>
    Upon this, Thomas Acheson of Washington rose advancing a short distance, greatly excited, exclaimed, laying his hand upon his heart: “I hope I may never see the day when my heart will renounce that blessed saying of the Scripture, ‘Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.’” Upon this saying he was so much affected that he burst into tears, and while a deep sympathetic feeling pervaded the entire assembly, he was about to retire to an adjoined room  when James Foster , not willing that this misapplication of Scripture should pass unchallenged , cried out, “Mr Acheson, I would remark that in the portion of Scripture you have quoted there is no reference, whatever to infant baptism,” without offering a reply Mr Acheson went out to weep alone; but this incident, while it foreshadowed some of the trials which the future had in store, failed to abate, in the least, the confidence which the majority of those present placed in the principles to which they were committed.
    </p>
    <p>After these preliminary meetings, a permanent organization “The Christian Association of Washington,” was formed on August 17, 1809. it was not a church but a study group, organized to discuss the best means of attaining Christian unity. A place to meet was needed, and it was decided that a building should be erected which would meet this need and serve as a schoolhouse for the community also. Accordingly, a log building was constructed in Washington County, Pennsylvania. 
    </p>
    <p>The association prepared a statement of its objectives. The actual writing fell to Thomas Campbell and emerged as “The Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington.” Upon presentation to the Association it was unanonymously  approved and ordered published in 1809. This was the outstanding literary production of the period and has been called the “Magna Charta of the Restoration Movement,” “the greatest document ever written in the Advocacy of Christian union. It certainly became the basis for serious thought and played its part in the restoration of the New Testament church.
    </p>
    <h2>AN EXTRACT FROM “THE DECLARATION OF THE CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION OF WASHINGTON.”</h2>
    <p>“From the series of events which have taken place in the churches for many years past, …as well as from what we know in general of the present state of things in the Christian world, we are persuaded that it is high time for us not only to think, but also TO ACT, for ourselves; to see with our owns eyes, and to take all round measures directly and immediately from the Divine standard; to this alone we feel ourselves Divinely bound to be conformed, as by this alone we must be judged. We are also persuaded that no man can be judged for his brother, so no man can judge for his brother; every man must be allowed to judge for himself, as every man must bear his own judgment – must give account of himself to God. We are also of the opinion that as the Divine word is equally binding upon all, so all lie under an equal obligation to be bound by it, and it alone; and not by any human interpretation of it... Moreover, being well aware, from sad experience, of the heinous nature and pernicious tendency of religious controversy among Christians; tired and sick of the bitter jarring and janglings of a party spirit, we would desire to be at rest; and, were it possible, we would also desire to adopt and recommend such measures as would give rest to our brethren throughout all the churches; as would restore unity, peace, and purity to the whole Church of God. This desirable rest, however, we utterly despair either to find for ourselves, or to be able to recommend to our brethren, by continuing amid the diversity and rancor of party contentions, the veering uncertainty and clashings of human opinions; nor, indeed, can we reasonably expect to find it anywhere but in Christ and his simple word, which is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Our desire therefore, for ourselves and our brethren would be, that rejecting human opinions and the inventions of men as of any authority, or as having any place in the Church of God, we might forever cease from further contentions about such things ; returning to and holding fast by the original standard; taking the Divine word alone for our rule …”

    </p>
    <p>Campbell then states that the purpose was to form themselves into a religious association called the “Christian Association of Washington” for the sole purpose of promoting simple evangelical Christianity free from all mixture of human opinions and inventions of men. Each member was to give according to his ability to promote the work, and the society was to use all means proper to encourage other groups to do the same. Campbell states that the society was not a church, but a voluntary association created for the purpose of promoting church reform and simple evangelical Christianity. In the main document “THE ADDRESS” containing lengthy 13 PRINCIPLES OF UNDENOMINATIONALISM, Campbell started the introductory part of the Article thus:
    </p>

    <p>“It is, to us, a pleasing consideration that all the Churches of Christ which mutually acknowledge each other as such, are not only agreed in the great doctrines of faith and holiness, but are also materially agreed as to positive ordinances of the Gospel institution. ….What a pity the Kingdom of God should be divide about such things (with regards to things of individual opinions). Who, then, would not be the first among us to give up human inventions in the worship of God, and to cease from imposing his private opinions upon his brethren, that our breaches might thus be healed?”
    </p>
    <div class="singlepost__thumbnail">
        <img src="./images/post2ref6.png" />
      </div>
      <h2>ALEXANDER CAMPBELL</h2>
    <p>The Campbell family again set out to America in August 1809. They arrived Washington, Pennsylvania, September 29 just as the proof-sheets of the Declaration and the Address had come from the press. Thomas Campbell was eager for his son to consider it carefully, Alexander told of the occasion in later years. He wrote: “On reading the proof-sheets of this “Declaration” as they issued from the press, immediately after my arrival in Washington, Pennsylvania, direct from Scotland, I observed to its author: “Then, sir, you must abandon and give up infant baptism, and some other practices for which it seems to me you cannot produce an express precept or an example in any book of the Christian Scriptures!” After a considerable pause, his response was to this effect: “To the law and to the testimony” we make our appeal. If not found therein, we, of course, must abandon it.”
    </p>
    <p>This Alexander Campbell rose to become the most popular figure in the whole Restoration Movement due to his zeal, eloquence, passion, knowledge. He had several debates with various top religious leaders that his name became synonymous with the Restoration Movement. Because of his works, some circular scholars began to identify the entire Restoration Movement as Campellism but neither him nor his Father initiated the Restoration Movement as already seen. The Campbells agreed to be guided by this principle. They determined to stand only for that which was “expressly exhibited upon the sacred page,” 
    </p>
    <p>and accept as the constitution, faith and worship of the church only that for which there can be produced a “Thus saith the LORD, either in express terms, or by approved precedent.” Alexander was well pleased with the conclusion his father had reached and became an enthusiastic supporter of the new cause. Copies of the Declaration and the Address were sent to all of the preachers near Washington with the request that they make any corrections or criticisms they thought necessary. None was received, and no preacher attempted a public reply. 
    </p>
    <p>“The Christian Association of Washington” moved to persuade all churches to give up their differences and unite into a common fellowship. When the association saw how it was difficult to convince denominations to give fellowship to any who would not accept their creeds, the associated which was originally designed not to be a church, now became willing to organize the group into a worshipping congregation. In October, 1810, the congregation applied for admission into Pittsburg Synod of the Presbyterian but was refused. In 1811 the Brush Run Church was organized as an independent congregation. The following day the church met for worship and celebrated the Lord’s Supper for the first time. Determined to follow the Scripture the congregation decided that weekly communion was to be observed since there was “approved precedent” for it. 
    </p>

      </div>
      <h2>JOHN WRIGHT</h2>
      <p>Pleading for Christian union on the basis of Scripture alone, the other Baptist churches of that region united in an undenominational fellowship. Fifteen congregations of German Baptists gave up triune immersions along with other erroneous views and entered into fellowship with the new movement. Since a number of congregations in the area had been started by associates of Barton W. Stone, a union was effected with them. The “Silver Creek Baptist Association” had accepted the plea for undenominationalism as set forth by the Campbells and united with Wright’s movement. As a result of these efforts, more than three thousand people from four distinct religious groups established fellowship as undenominational Christians. This provides a clear example of what can be done to eliminate the division that exists in Christendom.

    <div class="singlepost__thumbnail">
        <img src="./images/post2ref7.png" />
      </div>
      <h2>WALTER SCOTT</h2>
<p>After a few weeks of careful Bible study, he gave up Presbyterianism, renounced infant baptism and was immersed by Forrester. Scott was so effective as a teacher that Forrester soon turned the academy over to him that he might go into full time religious work himself. When Forrester withdrew from the school and shortly thereafter died accidently by drowning, Scott was left with the responsibility of both the school and the church. 
</p>
<p>In 1821-22, Walter Scott met with Alexander Campbell for the first time and they became close friends. They were trained in the same Presbyterian religious system and through their own study had reached almost identical convictions. These men began to work together in the restoration movement. The Restoration Movement owe him the credit for the clearest thinking and clear analysis of the cases of conversions found in the Book of Acts. He was also to become the first really successful evangelist in the Restoration period.
</p>
<h2>INTEGRATION OF DIFFERENT GROUPS</h2>
<p>What different independent Restoration Movements had in Common was full reliance on the Bible for religious authority and total rejection of human creeds and opinions. This made their mergers with one another easy because evidently, one Spirit was working in them and driving their passion for Christian Unity. The Bible is clear that the true Spirit of Christianity yearns for the Truth and Unity. 
</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:13  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
</p>
<p>1 John 4:6  We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
</p>
<p>1 John 4:6  We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
</p>
<p>The advocacy and mission of various independent Restoration Movements was one and that is, for all churches to drop their divisive names, recognize no human headship but Christ’s; drop all human creeds and embrace the Bible as the only guide in the Christian religion. This was the common philosophy that brought the different groups together into a common front in objectives, but different fronts in locations. 
</p>
<p>James O’Kelly and his Methodists groups did the work and established undenominational Christian churches in Virginia; Abner Jones and his Baptist Groups established the same churches in New England. Barton W. Stone and his massive Presbyterian Groups started the work in Kentucky and they established the Churches of Christ in Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. 
</p>
<p>As a result of these efforts, more than three thousand people from four distinct religious groups established fellowship as undenominational Christians who are now commonly known as Churches of Christ.
</p>
<p>John Wright and his Baptist groups worked in Indiana and dissolved the Baptist Churches of their region into the undenominational Christian Church. About fifteen congregations of German Baptists gave up triune immersions and other erroneous practices and joined the undenominational fellowship now commonly known as Churches of Christ.  
</p>
<p>As a number of congregations in that area were started by the groups of Barton W. Stone, they merged with John Wright’s group. Also, the “Silver Creek Baptist Association which had accepted the plea for undenominational Christianity as set forth by the Campbell group also easily united with John Wright’s group. 
</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania the Campbells (Father and Son) from Presbyterian background and a large combination  of multiple denominations faithful formed “The Christian Association of Washington” which later turned into an independent congregation known as Brush Run Church.
</p>
<p>As a result of conflicting views on the relevance of the Law of Moses in Christianity, a faction of the Brush Run Church who believed that the Law of Moses is not binding on Christians moved away, being led by Alexander Campbell and merged with Mahoning Baptist Association. It was this Mahoning Baptist Association that dissolved itself to make their churches undenominational Christian Churches now known as Churches of Christ. 
</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Walter Scott who had a Presbyterian background had joined George Forrester’s Independent congregation which he established based on his conviction that the Scripture is the only authority in all religious matters. As Forrester died, Walter Scott took over the leadership of this church. He met with Alexander Campbell in 1821-1822 and their groups were merged. This was how Christian Churches independently spread from USA to all countries of the world today and the New Testament Church now exists again, worshipping God in Spirit and Truth and upholding the Bible as their only rule of faith just as it was before the Apostasy championed by Constantine..

  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Because of the efforts of those great men, we have the Church today as it was in the early period of Christianity before the apostasy. Today, we have a church called the Church of Christ or Church of God again; today, we have a church that is not globally, nationally or regionally ruled by one man or group of men; today, we have a church that worships according to the New Testament pattern; today, we have a church that takes the Bible as the only rule of Faith without addition of human creeds or articles of Faith. 
</p>
<p>Today, Satan has failed to permanently bury the New Testament Christianity; today, we can worship God again in Spirit and in Truth without adulterated doctrines as created by uninspired men. We can only show gratitude to God for leading us to the Truth and freeing us from religious bondage, blindness and errors.   
</p>
<p>We must also celebrate the Reformers just like the Restorers because the Reformers laid the foundations the Restorers built on. The reformers spoke when speaking was forbidden by the apostate Roman Church and translated the Bible when it was a capital offence to do so. Majority of the Reformers gave their lives to make the eventual work of the Restorers easier. That is why the Bible says:
</p>
<p>“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.” (Romans 8:28)
</p>
<p>To remain steadfast in this purity from man-made doctrines, we must maintain the Bible standard in all things. We must reject innovations and creativities in things already set forth in the Bible. 
</p>
<p>Romans 16:16-17 <br>
    16  Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you. 17  Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.
