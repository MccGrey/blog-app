          2 Corinthians 7:4-5 <br /><br />
          4  Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of
          you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our
          tribulation. 5  For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had
          no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings,
          within were fears.

        <big>INTRODUCTION</big><br />
        <p>
          This lesson presents the state of the church in the early years of
          Christianity leading to the falling away from the faith. Events of
          first to third centuries AD were key to the eventual outlook of the
          Christian church in the later periods. This study will highlight some
          of the key internal and external factors that eventually led to the
          official apostasy of the Church of God. Shortly after its
          establishment about 33AD in Jerusalem, the Church of Christ was
          relatively peaceful but after a short while, troubles began from both
          outside and from within. In our text, Paul said, “but we were troubled
          on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.” These
          troubles on every side will be our main focus in this study.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>INTERNAL TROUBLES</big><br />
        <p>
          The early church had several challenges ranging from internal
          squabbles, doctrinal confusions arising from Judaism, Greek
          philosophy, immorality and theological manipulations through some
          apocryphal writings. We are going to explore some of these internal
          troubles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>DOCTRINAL CRISIS</big><br />
        <p>
          The church of the first century was greatly troubled by false
          doctrines which the apostles battled to stamp out. Some of these
          include: Introduction of Jewish Laws by Judaizing Christians:- The
          issue of Circumcision and observance of other laws of Moses which some
          Jewish Christians introduced led many astray like the churches in
          Galatia who returned to the observance Jewish holy days, months, times
          and years. (Galatians 3:8-11). The influence of Judaizing Christians
          of Jewish extraction even made the Great Apostle Peter to withdraw
          from eating with Gentiles Christians when he saw some Jews coming and
          of course, Paul confronted him for that. (Galatians 2:11-14) Paul in
          his epistle to the Galatians declared to them thus, “Christ is become
          of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye
          are fallen from grace.” (Galatians 5:4)  In fact, later in history,
          this Jewish trend led the apostate church into patterning its itself
          after the Jewish priestly system where Church officers began to act
          like Levites and the members were like other Jews in what is called
          Clergy and Laity. Some categories of the 2 priests like Bishops later
          began to wear skull caps like the ancient Jews. The apostate church
          created special religious days as holy days just like the Jewish
          special days and season. That is why they celebrate Day of
          Annunciation (the Angel Gabriel spoke to Mary), Day of Ascension,
          Lent, Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, etc. Meanwhile, in Christianity, no
          day is specially a holy day but Christians only gathered every first
          day of the week to worship (Acts 20:7, 1 Corinth. 16:1-2), but they
          didn’t regard that day as a Sabbath but the apostate church turned it
          into a new day of rest. Just like Judaizers, they began the recitation
          of the abolished Ten Commandments. (2 Corinthians 3:6-14) They also
          introduced the use of carnal ordinances such as candles, incense,
          special robes, etc. (Hebrews 9:8-10, Colossians 2:20-22)
        </p>
        <p>
          Resurrection:- <br />
          Some prominent Christians like Hymenaeus and Philetus and their likes
          went about spreading false teaching that Resurrection had already
          passed. (2 Timothy 2:17-18) May be, their argument was based on the
          fact that when Jesus resurrected, graves opened and many dead saints
          came back to life. (Matthew 27:52-53)
        </p>
        <p>
          Charismatic:- <br />
          following the sudden cessation of miraculous manifestations in all the
          churches at the end of the first century, some members who were
          desperate to acquire miraculous gifts began to claim they received
          such powers even though no apostle was alive to lay hands on them to
          impart the gifts. This was recorded to be more disturbing in the early
          second century when many began to claim gifts they did not have. It
          was this period that Montanus from the village of Arboda in the town
          of Mysia who was a priest of pagan temple of Cybele before his
          conversion continued to practice his emotionalism that was customary
          to the worship of Cybele. He would go into a great trance and began to
          utter some things. He claimed that in one of such trances, God spoke
          to him and through him and he succeeded in converting two women –
          Priscilla and Maximilla who began to prophesy. Mattox, F.W., (1961, pg
          77). The Eternal Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nature of Christ:- <br />
          This was a doctrine questioning the divinity of Christ which was
          introduced by Arius – one of the elders of the Church in Alexandria,
          Egypt. He said that Christ had a beginning later than God the Father
          but earlier than the creations which means that Christ is not eternal
          like the Father. This doctrine troubled the church greatly in early
          fourth century and was the major reason for the conveyance of the
          Council of Nicaea about 325AD. It was during this council (which was
          chaired by the unbaptized Emperor Constantine) that the first
          Christian Creed (I Believe In God) was written.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>POWER TUSSLES</big><br />
        <p>
          In 2 Corinthians 10:12, Paul said, “For we dare not make ourselves of
          the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves:
          but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves
          among themselves, are not wise.” That was the spirit Satan put in some
          members to shift their focus from heaven to be looking at who is
          superior. This attitude was prominent among some Jewish Christians who
          even began to look down on the apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Jesus recounted a prophecy concerning his afflictions, “I will
          smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.” (Mark 14:27),
          the same goes to the various leaders of the church. Jesus said in
          Mathew 12:29 that Someone cannot come into a strong man’s house and
          spoil his goods except he first ties the man with rope and then robs
          his house.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was why Satan always targeted the leaders of the church,
          especially the resident ministers. In the book of Revelations 1:20,
          the angels (Greek Aggelos – G32 = Ministers) of the seven churches of
          Asia were represented as stars while the congregations they were
          leading were symbolized as golden candlesticks.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand,
          and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of
          the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
          the seven churches.”
        </p>
        <p>
          If the star is bright, its congregation will be bright and if the star
          is dim, its congregation will be dim. That may be why members of the
          church in Thyatira were seduced to commit fornication because they
          allowed a woman called Jezebel to teach and someone only gives out
          what he has. (Rev 2:20). No wonder Satan has always tried to bring the
          church leaders down at different times. Some examples are:
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul <br />
          Some members challenged his power as an apostle, (1 Corinthians
          9:1-2), Some criticized his manner of speech and other things. (2
          Corinthians 10:10)
        </p>
        <p>
          John and co. <br />
          Apostle John lamented as follows: “I wrote unto the church: but
          Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth
          us not. 10  Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he
          doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content
          therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and
          forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.” (3
          John 1:9-10  9) Etc
        </p>
        <p>
          Timothy <br />
          Timothy didn’t have any clear case of being troubled by members but
          Paul admonished him to endure hardness. (2 Tim 2:3). He was also urged
          by Paul not to allow anybody to despise his youth. (1 Timothy 4:12)
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the reason Paul said that some indeed preach Christ but out
          of envy and strife. (Philippians 1:15). It was due to all these
          internal troubles by Jews and influential Gentile Christians that were
          in the habit of disrespecting their leaders (Apostles, Elders and
          Preachers) that some early Christians were given such bad tags as:
        </p>
        <p>
          - False brethren (Galatians 2:4) <br /><br />
          - False Apostles (2 Corinth. 11:12-13)<br /><br />
          - Enemies of the cross of Christ (Philippians 3:18)<br /><br />
          - Antichrists (1 John 2:18-19)<br /><br />
          - Natural brute beasts (2 Peter 2:1-12)<br /><br />

          - Grievous wolves (Acts 20:29-30) <br />
          - Etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things were not just rosy in the early church with regards to
          relationship among church leaders and Jesus said, “Every kingdom
          divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided
          against a house falleth.” (Luke 11:17)
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>THE NEW TESTAMENT APOCRYPHAL WRITINGS</big><br />
        <p>
          Those of us practicing Christianity after the canon of the Scriptures
          might not know what Christians in first, second and third centuries
          suffered because of lack of the availability of the New Testament
          Bible. A lot of uninspired New Testament writings were in circulation
          at the same time as the New Testament books and it was not easy to
          determine which was a a forgery and which was an authentic inspired
          Word of God or which was a mere uninspired bible admonition. These
          uncertainties also troubled the church at that time. Some of the
          uninspired writings in circulation at that time included
        </p>
        <p>
          Clement of Rome (About 97AD): <br />
          An Epistle from Clement, an Elder from the Church of Christ in Rome
          (not Romanized yet) to the Corinthian Church urging them to respect
          their Elders and reminded them about Paul’s epistles to them on the
          same issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignatius of Antioch: <br />
          About 150AD, Ignatius was arrested for martyrdom. On his way to Rome,
          he wrote an epistle to the church urging them to follow their Elders
          and Deacons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Epistle of Barnabas: <br />
          This epistle was previously believed to be written by Barnabas who
          accompanied Paul in his missionary journey but a more careful study of
          it proved otherwise. The epistle was however written to convince the
          Christian Jews that the death of Christ has brought an end to the Law
          of Moses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Didache: <br />
          The Didache is also known as The Teaching of The Twelve Apostles.
          There is no agreement about its date but it was said to be quoted
          around 200AD but the author is unknown. This epistle admonished the
          churches to elect for themselves Bishops and Deacons worthy of the
          Lord and goes ahead to list some of the qualifications as Paul listed
          before. Like Paul said in 2 Thessalonians 2:7  that “For the mystery
          of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until
          he be taken out of the way.”, the book has this instruction on
          baptism:
        </p>
        <p>
          “baptize in this way … in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
          in living water, but if you have not living water, baptize in other
          water. And if thou canst not in cold, in warm, if thou have neither,
          pour water thrice on the head…”
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Colossians 2:12 says, “Buried with him in baptism, wherein
          also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God.”
          And Romans 6:3 says, “ Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
          into death.”. This was how sprinkling baptism started early between
          250-400AD) Constantine was even said to be sprinkled when he was about
          to dies which means he was not even a Christian as at the time he
          chaired the meeting of the Bishops and drafted the Creed agreed in the
          Council of Nicaea about 325AD.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Papias (125-150AD): <br />
          Papias was a bishop in Hierapolis in Phrygia. His writings disappeared
          early enough but Irenaeus and Eusebius quoted sufficiently from his
          book to show that he gathered all the oral statements of the Apostles
          he could hear and put them in writing. Eusebius said he started the
          idea of the millennial reign of Christ; that is, Christ coming again
          to reign as an earthly King for a thousand years despite Jesus telling
          Pilate that “my kingdom is not of this world.” (John 18:36)
        </p>
        <p>
          Polycarp (115-156AD): <br />
          Polycarp was an elderly Bishop of Church of Christ in Smyrna who was
          martyred on 22 nd February 156AD at the age of 86 Years. Around 115AD,
          he wrote an epistle to the Church in Philippi. His letter started in
          this way, “Polycarp and the elders with him.” He admonished them in
          godliness, quoting various bible passages. Irenaeus said that Polycarp
          was ordained Bishop by the witnesses (apostles) themselves. The
          contents of the Letter of Clement to Corinthian Church and the letter
          of Polycarp to Philippian Church show that each congregation
          completely autonomous and was in no way legally or administratively
          connected to another neither was there a cluster administrative system
          in form of Parishes and Diocese as was later than seen in the apostate
          church. This is why we should not hide under government or legal
          registration to tactically bring the churches into a form of
          centralized administrative system because each congregation is
          designed to have full legal and administrative autonomy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shepherd of Hermas (140-150AD): <br />
          It was believed to have been written by Hermas who was a brother to
          Pius; who was a bishop of Rome (not Romanized yet) from 140 to 150AD.
          Hermas was a slave of Roman wealthy woman named Rhoda. His writing was
          to correct an error by some Christians that there is no forgiveness
          for a sin committed after baptism. He wrote to prove that sin
          committed after baptism could be forgiven.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more writings that were believed to be outright forgeries
          such as The Acts of Peter, Gospel of Andrew, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>IMMORALITY</big><br />

        <p>
          The Church was also plagued with acts of immorality one of which Paul
          addressed in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 where a Christian slept with his
          step mother. We also see the case the Lord Jesus addressed in the
          Church of Christ in Thyatira where a woman called Jezebel was allowed
          to teach and seduced members to commit fornication. (Revelation 2:20)
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>EXTERNAL TROUBLES</big><br />
        <big>JEWISH HOSTILITY</big><br />
        <p>
          The first message of the earthly ministry of Jesus was preached in
          Nazareth where he grew up and was chaotic. They wanted to throw him
          down headlong from a high pedestal and banished him from Nazareth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke 4:16-30 <br />
          …28  And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were
          filled with wrath, 29  And rose up, and thrust him out of the city,
          and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built,
          that they might cast him down headlong. ,30  But he passing through
          the midst of them went his way.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the church started, it was peaceful and the church was at first
          using the Jewish Temple and Synagogues as places of worship until the
          opposition of Jewish leaders started and Gentiles began to be
          converted. From that time, Jewish hostility began. The Jews called the
          church with all kinds of derogatory names such as the Sect of the
          Nazarenes, This Way, A Movement, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Acts 24:5  For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover
          of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader
          of the sect of the Nazarenes:
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jews were a thorn in the flesh for the church, stoning Stephen to
          death and instigating Herod to kill James and others. In fact, Paul
          described some of them as beasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Corinthians 15:32  If after the manner of men I have fought with
          beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let
          us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.(Also see Acts 19:28-31, Titus
          1:12, Jude 10)
        </p>
        <p>
          The Jews were accusing Christians as being anti-Jews and anti-Moses.
          They saw the Christians as people who turned the world upside down.
          They raised all kinds of conspiracy theories against the Christians in
          order to paint them in bad lights before Roman authorities as a people
          that plot sedition against the government. (Acts 17:5-6)
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>ROMAN STATE PERSECUTION:</big><br />
        <p>
          Right from the periods before Christ, Romans kept religion and
          government in close relationship. They were traditional idol
          worshipers with multiple gods. In fact, every day of the week had a
          certain god it was dedicated to. Some sources gave the following
          information:
        </p>
        <p>
          - Sunday – For Sol, goddess of the Sun or Sun’s day <br /><br />
          - Monday – For Mani, goddess of the moon, Mani’s day<br /><br />

          - Tuesday – For Tyr, god of war, Tyr’s day<br /><br />
          - Wednesday – For Odin, the Raven god, also known as Wooden, Wooden’s
          day<br /><br />
          - Thursday – For Thor, god of strength and storms, Thor’s day<br /><br />
          - Friday – For Frigg, goddess of marriage, Frigg’s day.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may be why early Christians christened the day of their gathering
          as The Lord’s Day (Revelation 1:10). Not all the gods mentioned above
          were necessarily of Roman origin but classification of days according
          to gods will help us know that Roman Empire had a strong attachment to
          pagan religion. Religion was supported or rather promoted by the
          Empire because they also worshipped their emperors, dead or alive.
          Foreign religions were looked at with suspicion as subversive to the
          state and a source of conspiracy against Roman rule. This showed in
          the kind of relationship that existed between the Jews and Romans
          whose religions where in direct opposition to each other with regards
          to objects of worship. It was natural for such state suspicion of
          foreign religions especially Judaism to also pass down to
          Christianity. The preaching that Jesus is King and Christians share in
          his kingdom all seemed to the Romans as leading to a rebellion.
          Christianity was naturally an illegal religion at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only under the reign of Gaius Caesar who was commonly called
          Caligula (37-41AD) that Christians did not receive any official
          persecution. From the period of Claudius Caesar (41-54AD), official
          persecution started as Claudius made Herod Agrippa the governor of
          Judea who under the instigation of the Jews killed James the brother
          of John and also arrested Peter to be killed after Passover. (Acts
          12:1-3). Details of chronicles of official persecutions will be
          treated later.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were a lot of lies and suspicions against Christianity from all
          parts of the empire. Some even called them a secrete cult and
          cannibals because of the Lord’s supper. All such accusations by both
          the Jews and state players caused a public resentment for Christianity
          which necessitated early apologists to make a defense of Christianity.
          Please note that apology in this context doesn’t mean asking for
          forgiveness but written or oral Advocacy or Defense of the Christian
          Faith.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>Some of the early Christian apologists are:</big><br />

        <p>
          QUADRATUS (125-129AD):- <br />
          He wrote to Hadrian the Emperor when he visited Athens in 129AD
          explaining the genuineness of the works of Jesus and the miracles he
          performed. He explained those things were a public knowledge as some
          of the people cured or raised from the dead even lived until their
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          ARISTIDES (138-147AD):- <br />
          The writing of Aristides was seen as the first complete document in
          defense of Christianity and was still in circulation in the days
          Eusebius the church historian. He contrasted Christian worship with
          human religions with reference to the four gospels, Acts of the
          Apostles and 1 Peter. His closing chapters gave information about the
          practices of the church in the second century.
        </p>
        <p>
          JUSTIN MARTYR (103-165AD):- <br />
          He was converted in Ephesus about 133AD. He later came to Rome where
          he did some writings. One of his writings was “Apology” (Defense) to
          Antonius about 150AD in which he appealed to him to investigate
          Christianity to see that Christians were not atheists or idolaters or
          immoral but that Christianity is nobler than pagan religions. Another
          of his book is “Dialogue with Trypho”, a Jew.
        </p>
        <p>
          TATIAN (125-200AD):- <br />
          He traveled widely studying Greek Philosophy but when he came to Rome,
          Justin converted him to Christianity before the middle of the second
          century. On returning to Greece about 152-155AD, he wrote an “Address
          to the Greeks” in which he ridiculed their claim of superiority and
          shows that Christianity holds the higher position. He said that Greek
          immorality was shown by their sculpture and art, in their sport and
          also in their religion. He argued that Moses was more ancient than
          Homer, living even before the Trojan wars.
        </p>
        <p>
          MELITO (169-190AD):- <br />
          He was a bishop of Sardis – one of the seven churches of Asia.
          According to Eusebius, he wrote up to eighteen to twenty compositions.
          His “Apology” was written around 170AD. In it, he shows the emperor
          that the church is a positive force for good in the empire; and that,
          instead of persecuting it, the emperor would do well to defend it and
          use its influences. Titles of some of his other writings are “On the
          Lord’s Day” and “On Baptism”.
        </p>
        <p>
          ATHENAGORAS (177-180AD):- <br />
          He was a teacher in Athens and an example of a person converted to
          Christianity through personal reading of the scripture. In his writing
          “Supplication for the Christians” written about 180AD, he refutes the
          charges made against the Christians and shows that pagan gods are
          human invention since they have the same weaknesses as men. He also
          wrote a treatise “On the Resurrection of the Dead.”
        </p>
        <p>
          THEOPHILOS (190AD):- <br />
          According to Eusebius, Theophilos was the sixth bishop of Antioch. He
          also became a Christian through personal reading of the scripture. He
          wrote his Apology to Autolycus around 190AD. Autolycus was an educated
          pagan official who he wanted to convert to Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were the earliest Christians Apologists. The later Apologists
          will not be discussed in full here but let us make a light mention of
          some of them:
        </p>
        <p>
          IRENAEUS OF ASIA MINOR BORN AROUND 130AD:- <br />
          He heard Polycarp of the Church of Christ in Smyrna preach and became
          a Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA (150-215AD):- <br />His full name was Titus
          Flavius Clement. He was a native of Athens.
        </p>
        <p>
          TERTULLIAN (155-223AD):- <br />
          The church was established in North Africa very early and it was
          believed that the bible was first translated into Latin in the region
          of Carthage (now Tunisia). It was here that Tertullian was born around
          155AD.
        </p>
        <p>
          HYPPOLYTUS (170-236AD):- <br />
          He was born around 170AD and he studied under Irenaeus in Gaul
          (France). Origin tells of him visiting Rome and hearing Hyppolytus
          preach. He was a fiery preacher and a puritan in morals.
        </p>
        <p>
          ORIGEN (185-254AD):- <br />
          He was born around 185AD into a pagan family of Alexandria, Egypt.
          When he was eight years old, his father and mother were converted to
          Christianity and they remained faithful.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>THE INFLUENCE OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY</big><br />
        <p>
          Docetism:- <br />
          The word docetic comes from a Greek word which means, “to seem.”
          Docetism is therefore a belief that Jesus Christ did not really suffer
          on the cross, but rather, He just “seemed” to suffer. The doctrine
          teaches that mortal body was evil and so, Jesus couldn’t have assumed
          the normal sinful flesh like other humans have. I personally heard
          this teaching myself sometime around 2011 in my home town from a
          leader of a Church that claimed to be Church of Christ also but don’t
          use signboards, believe in modern miraculous gifts, etc. The man said
          that a special body was prepared for Jesus and quoted Hebrews 10:5
          which says, “Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith,
          Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou
          prepared me:” What this means is that this Greek philosophy-influenced
          doctrine was why John said,
        </p>
        <p>
          1 John 4:2-4 <br />
          2  Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that
          Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 3  And every spirit that
          confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God:
          and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it
          should come; and even now already is it in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may also be the reason why Paul warned Colossian Church to shun
          Greek philosophies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colossians 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and
          vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the
          world, and not after Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note also that Asceticism is one of the doctrines of Greek Philosophy.
          Asceticism means living away from the society which is deemed to be
          evil or defiled. It came as a result of Gnostic emphasis that all
          matter is evil. Some Christians were led to asceticism which will be
          discussed in greater details in future episodes. It was from this
          doctrine that monastery life developed and people began to become
          celibate as Monks and Nuns. It was this doctrine of asceticism that
          the Holy Spirit called the Doctrine Of Devils.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Timothy 4:1-3  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
          times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
          spirits, and doctrines of devils; 2  Speaking lies in hypocrisy;
          having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 3  Forbidding to
          marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to
          be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the
          truth.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>CONCLUSION:</big><br />
        <p>
          All the above internal and external troubles weakened the church and
          made it porous which paved the way for apostasy to happen. When the
          leaders are weakened, persecuted and killed and internally, canal
          Christians trouble the church from within, it is only natural for
          Satan to have an easy access into the church and that was what exactly
          happened. Apostasy means that the church has been driven away from
          Christ to Satan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Galatians 1:6-9  I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that
          called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7  Which is
          not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the
          gospel of Christ. 8  But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach
          any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,
          let him be accursed. 9  As we said before, so say I now again, If any
          man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let
          him be accursed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faithful Christians that want to serve God in spirit and in truth are
          encouraged to separate themselves and return to the original Church.
          This is the advocacy of today’s Churches of Christ world over. If you
          want to serve God in the same way he was originally served in the
          early centuries of Christianity and desire to have a real hope of
          making heaven, then be converted today. Worship with any Church of
          Christ nearest to you. May God bless you.
