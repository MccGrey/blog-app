        <big>INTRODUCTION</big><br />
        <p>
          In the Book of Revelation 1:1, we read:  <br /><br />

          “The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto
          his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and
          signified it by his angel unto his servant John:”<br /><br />

          God sent a message to the Christian world through the seven churches
          in Asia Minor telling them about the events that would shortly happen
          in the world which would affect the Christian religion and he
          signified those events with symbolic images. It therefore requires
          critical bible studies to understand the messages the symbols convey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the book of Revelations is highly symbolic, some Christian
          teachers have portrayed it as a “NO GO AREA” but I don’t belong to
          that school of thought. God in the book of 2 Timothy 2:15  demands
          that we should “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman
          that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
          truth.”<br /><br />

          This is because, the mystery and the manifold wisdom of God is made
          known by the church. (Ephesians 3:9-10). If therefore, the church
          should shy away from the book of Revelations, then, which group of
          people should study it and make use of the knowledge it contains?
          Deuteronomy 29:29 says that the hidden things belong to God but the
          things that are revealed, belong to us. Revelations is therefore a
          book of revealed things and therefore belongs to us. Since the book of
          Revelations is a message to the church, the church must seek to
          understand it and not to run away from it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS LESSON</big><br />
        <p>
          God delivered the Book of Revelations as a message to the seven
          churches of Asia and in the world. The aim of the Book of Revelations
          would be defeated if the church understands nothing in the book.
          <br /><br />

          John the Apostle saw visions of things that would affect the history
          of Christianity in Revelations 12-13 and 17-18. This lesson seeks to
          explain those things and how they impacted the Christian religious
          history. The knowledge will help in building our faith in Christ and
          belief of the truth; as our salvation is not only dependent on knowing
          that Jesus Christ is the Lord and Saviour and accepting him, but also
          dependent on our belief of the truth. If we don’t know what the truth
          is, how can we know what to believe and what to reject?<br /><br />

          “But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
          beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to
          salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
          truth.” (2 Thessalonians 2:13) <br /><br />

          If one does not understand the book of Revelations, he is likely to be
          deceived and damned for all eternity hence, the need for this lesson
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>THE THINGS TO STUDY IN THIS LESSON </big><br />
        <p>
          There are four symbolic beasts we shall study in this lesson with a
          view to unraveling what they signify. They include: <br /><br />
          1. The red Dragon with seven heads and ten horns.<br /><br />
          2. The Leopard with seven heads and ten horns.<br /><br />
          3. The beast with the appearance of a lamb.<br /><br />
          4. The scarlet (red) beast with seven heads and ten horns and the
          harlot that sits on it.<br /><br />
          Our objective is to understand what these figures represent and how
          they affect the Christian religion. All the symbolic images are great
          bible lessons packaged by our God for the church. Our God is a great
          teacher; He used those symbols as teaching aids to simplify and
          summarize the lessons about historical events that would affect the
          Christian religion. If the church fails to understand those symbols,
          the messages would be lost and the purpose of writing the book would
          be defeated.

        <big>THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE MYSTERY OF THE BEASTS</big><br />
        <p>
          The visions of Revelations 12 – 13 and Revelations 17-18 point to the
          events of history of the church. One beast that is central to the
          events and to which other beasts and the harlot are linked to, is the
          beast with seven heads and its trade mark TEN HORNS. <br /><br />

          This beast in Revelation 17:3 and Revelations 13:1 had earlier been
          represented in Daniel’s vision of the world Kingdoms or Empires as the
          fourth beast having ten horns which he said represented the fourth
          Kingdom. (Dan. 7:23) It is also represented by the fourth segment of
          the Image of Nebuchadnezzar's dream with TEN TOES which Daniel also
          described as the fourth Kingdom. (Dan. 2:40)
          <br /><br />
          Seven heads and ten horns are therefore the symbolic representation of
          the Roman Empire which was the fourth of the four World Empires. The
          scarlet-coloured beast with seven heads and ten horns and the Leopard
          with seven heads and ten horns in the book of Revelations refer to the
          same fourth world Empire – Rome. Other images (the Harlot and the
          Lamb) in the visions are tied to the influence of the same Roman
          Empire on the Christian religion.

        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Revelation 18:2-4 2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying,
          Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation
          of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every
          unclean and hateful bird. 3  For all nations have drunk of the wine of
          the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have
          committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are
          waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. 4  And I heard
          another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye
          be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
          <br /><br />

          As the woman is the Mother of all Harlots, she introduced religious
          perversions to Christianity ranging from idol and image worship to
          enforcement of celibacy, promotion of forgiveness of sins after death
          in form of Purgatory and Indulgence, corruption of baptism, etc. Later
          Christian bodies (denominations) would continue with more religious
          perversions which Rome initiated as the mother of Christian religious
          perversions. The faithful Christians are warned to come out her
          perverted religious system and hold fast to the faith once delivered
          unto the saints. (Jude 3) <br /><br />

          1 Timothy 4:1  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
          times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
          spirits, and doctrines of devils.<br /><br />

          2 Thessalonians 2:15  Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the
          traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

        <big>CONCLUSION</big><br />
        <p>
          THE VISION OF THE WOMAN ON THE SCARLET BEAST It is clear that the
          woman sitting on the red-coloured beast is the capital city of Roman
          Empire now represented by the Vatican City while the beast she is
          sitting on is the Empire itself. The vision is about the religious
          corruption or apostasy (perdition) that symbolic woman (City) brought
          upon the Christian religion which makes her the Mother of all harlots.
          (Rev. 17:5). <br /><br />

          THE VISION OF THE DRAGON, LEOPARD AND THE LAMB This summarily tells us
          the source of Power of the Roman Pontiff represented by the Lamb. The
          Dragon (Satan) gave his seat and great authority to the Leopard (Roman
          Empire), After the Leopard, the Lamb (Roman Pontiff) used the same
          authority of the Leopard (Roman Empire). In all these, Satan’s
          authority is still what is in display. This is what the Holy Spirit
          pointed out in the prophecy below:
          <br /><br />
          1 Timothy 4:1  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
          times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
          spirits, and doctrines of devils.
          <br /><br />
          Jesus said, “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
          unto the churches” (Revelation 2:29) but if anyone wants to be
          ignorant, let him be ignorant. I thank you for taking this study
          journey with me. May God bless you.
