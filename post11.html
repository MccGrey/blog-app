        <big>INTRODUCTION</big><br />
        <p>
          A lot of professing Christians feel free to boldly say, I belong to
          this denomination or I belong to that denomination without knowing
          that they are indicting themselves before God just because, they seem
          not to understand the meaning of the term “DENOMINATION” and
          commandment of God against it. The word Denomination does not resonate
          with God because it counters the principles of Christianity as
          designed by God. In this lesson, we are going to see why the term
          “DENOMINATION” is offensive to the Christian religion.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE TERM DENOMINATION?</big><br />
        <p>
          Advanced English Dictionary defines Denomination in three different
          ways:
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>First Definition:</big><br />
        <p>
          A group of religious congregations having its own organization and
          distinct faith.
        </p>
        <br />
        <big>Why is this offensive?</big><br />
        <p>
          What the Bible says: Bible says we should not be distinct from each
          other or have distinct faith but that all Christians should have one
          faith and speak the same thing and be of one mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Corinthians 1:10: <br />
          Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
          that ye all speak the same thing, <br /><br />

          and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly
          joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.  Ephesians
          4:5: 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism.
          <br /><br />
          Philippians 1:27<br />
          Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ:
          that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your
          affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving
          together for the faith of the gospel; 
          <br /><br />
          1 Timothy 1:3:<br />
          3 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
          Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other
          doctrine,
        </p>
        <big>Second Definition:</big><br /><br />
        <p>
          Identifying word or words by which someone or something is called and
          classified or distinguished from others.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <big>Why is this offensive?</big><br />

        <p>
          What the Bible says: Bible says that there should not be variance or
          distinctions among us neither should we separate from the original one
          group or church. It also forbids us from going beyond what is written
          by assuming new names.
        </p>

        <p>
          Galatians 5:19-21: <br />
          19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery,
          fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,  20 idolatry, witchcraft,
          hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,  ...
          and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also
          told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not
          inherit the kingdom of God. <br /><br />
          1 John 2:19: <br />
          They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been
          of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out,
          that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <big>Third definition:</big><br />
        <p>A class of one kind in a system.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <big>Why is this offensive?</big><br /><br />
        <p>
          What the Bible says: Bible says that we should not differ from one
          another because by one Spirit, we are baptized into only one body.
          Again, Jesus prayed that all his disciples should be made perfect in
          one so the idea of “one kind in a system” is a rebellion to Jesus wish
          that all believers should be perfectly one.
        </p>
        <p>
          John 17:21-23 <br />
          21 that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in
          thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that
          thou hast sent me.  22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given
          them; that they may be one, even as we are one:  23 I in them, and
          thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world
          may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast
          loved me.
          <br /><br />
          1 Corinthians 4:6-7: 6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure
          transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might
          learn in us not to think of men above that which is written... 7 For
          who maketh thee to differ from another?
